## Coal Combustion Fundamentals

### Basic Principles

- **Combustion Process**:

  - Coal combustion involves chemical reactions between hydrocarbons and oxygen
  - Air is typically used as the oxygen source, though pure oxygen may also be used
  - Combustion is an exothermic chemical reaction

- **Air Composition**:
  - Contains approximately 21% oxygen by volume and 23% by weight
  - Approximately 20% (or 1/5th) is oxygen and 80% is nitrogen
  - Also contains other gases, moisture, and inert components
  - Exact percentages should be used in calculations

### Chemical Reactions

- **Energy Release Mechanism**:
  - Energy is released from internal energy stored in chemical bonds
  - Includes C-C, C-H, C-O, C-S bonds present in feed materials
  - Products (CO₂, H₂O) have lower internal bond energy than reactants
  - Chemical reactions involve breaking bonds in reactants and forming new bonds in products

### Energy Considerations

- **Energy Storage and Release**:

  - Energy in coal/fossil fuel is stored in different chemical bonds
  - Energy level of hydrocarbons (FC+VM) is higher than the products (CO₂, H₂O, etc.)
  - Total energy release per unit mass is calculated as Gross Calorific Value (GCV) in kcal/kg
  - Activation energy is required to initiate chemical reaction and electron interchange

- **Historical Energy Cycle**:
  - Same amount of energy was consumed during photosynthesis (CO₂+H₂O in the presence of sunlight)
  - After photosynthesis, plants convert glucose to various hydrocarbons
  - Enthalpy balance: enthalpy of CₓHᵧ+O₂ equals enthalpy of CO₂, H₂O plus released heat energy

### Reaction Kinetics

- **Reaction Rates**:

  - Individual hydrocarbons in coal/fossil fuel react with O₂ at different rates
  - For the same 1 kg mass, different fuels require different times to complete reaction
  - Coals of different origins may burn at different rates (kcal/min)
  - Space time varies between fuels

- **Influencing Factors**:

  - Coal origin variations: plant type, geological age, specific plant parts
  - Mineral matter and inorganic salt composition modifies reaction kinetics
  - Some compounds may have catalytic (accelerating) or inhibitory (slowing) effects
  - Two similar fuels can have different rates of chemical reaction/combustion/pyrolysis/gasification

- **Analytical Limitations**:
  - Standard coal characterization does not identify specific chemical compounds
  - Focuses instead on thermal stability behavior (VM, FC), total residue, energy (GCV)
  - Proximate analysis, CHNSO, GCV analysis do not provide complete information about fuel
  - Detailed chemical analysis is difficult, time-consuming, and costly

### Combustion Reactions

- **Reaction Types**:

  - Complete combustion: CₓHᵧ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
  - Partial combustion: CₓHᵧ + O₂ → CO + H₂O
  - For simplicity, coal combustion is often expressed as: C + O₂ → CO₂

- **Additional Reactions**:

  - Other elements in hydrocarbons (S, N, P, Cl, O, etc.) participate in oxidation reactions
  - Corresponding oxides form depending on reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)
  - Incomplete reactions may release unburned hydrocarbons or gases (N₂, Cl₂, etc.)

- **Application Considerations**:
  - Coal combustion/reaction mechanism must be understood before firing in boilers
  - Reaction rates vary with hydrocarbon structure (different values of x, y in CₓHᵧ)
  - Coal sources and maturity affect hydrocarbon composition

### Diffusion Control in Combustion

- **Surface Reaction and Ash Formation**:

  - Air/O₂ initially reacts with external surface of coal
  - Shortly after combustion begins, an ash layer forms on the outside of the coal
  - Fresh O₂ must diffuse through this ash layer to reach unreacted coal (diffusion-controlled reaction)
  - Combustion product gases (CO₂, H₂O, SO₂, etc.) must diffuse outward through the ash layer

- **Rate Limitation Effects**:

  - Combustion rate/energy release rate depends on diffusion rate of gases through ash layer
  - Combustion rate gradually slows down as ash layer thickens
  - Larger coal particles require longer time for complete combustion (increased residence time)
  - Increased residence time creates possibility of unburned carbon

- **Fuel Characterization Challenges**:
  - Hydrocarbon composition significantly determines the reaction rate
  - Standard measurements (VM, FC, H, C etc.) do not fully represent exact fuel characteristics
  - Heat release rate (kcal/min) is more important than total heat content (kcal/kg) for combustion efficiency

### Impact of Ash Content

- **High-Ash Coal Considerations**:

  - Combustion of high-ash coal is relatively slower and more difficult
  - Ash layer properties critically affect combustion:
    - Thickness
    - Porosity
    - Mineral matter composition
  - These properties control diffusion rates of gases (O₂, CO₂, and others)

- **Industrial Applications**:
  - Pulverized coal combustion using particles <75 μm is standard in power plants
  - Smaller particle size reduces diffusion limitations
  - Gross Calorific Value (GCV in kcal/kg) is less different than rate of heat release (kcal/min)
  - Combustion rate determines overall efficiency in power generation

## Thermogravimetric Analysis for Coal

### Methodology

- **Process Description**:

  - Used to analyze combustion behavior of solid fuels (coal, biomass, etc.)
  - Coal is heated in oxidative environment (O₂) from ambient to high temperature
  - Typical heating rate of 10°C/min is applied
  - Mass loss occurs due to heat and O₂ (moisture loss/decomposition/oxidation)
  - Sensitive balance measures mass loss, which is recorded by software

- **Analysis Applications**:
  - Mass loss profile is analyzed against temperature
  - Helps assess reasons for mass loss and chemical reactions
  - Indirectly represents hydrocarbon combustion characteristics
  - Essential for predicting industrial combustion behavior

### Industrial Relevance

- **Plant-Scale Considerations**:
  - Coal in industrial settings must burn within specified time frame
  - Heat release must occur at specific zones (e.g., boiler tubes)
  - Coal properties vary significantly with source
  - Different coals have different combustion rates
  - Combustion profile relates to hydrocarbon types reacting with O₂
  - Essential to supply appropriate coal type (design coal) for optimal combustion

### Key Temperature Points

- **Critical Temperature Markers**:

  - Tᵢ (Ignition Temperature): Where rate of mass loss exceeds 1%/min
  - Tₚ (Peak Temperature): Where rate of mass loss (DTGₘₐₓ) is maximum
  - Tf (Burnout Temperature): Where rate of mass loss falls below 1%/min

- **Combustion Sequence**:
  - Initial moisture loss occurs around 100°C
  - Volatile matter (VM) release begins at 300-400°C
  - VM ignites easily, preparing fixed carbon (FC) for combustion
  - Main combustion phase follows with significant weight loss and energy release

### Temperature Profile Interpretation

- **Ignition Temperature (Tᵢ)**:

  - After moisture loss (~100°C), heating releases volatile hydrocarbons
  - Released through presence in fuel or thermal cracking
  - VM ignites when concentration exceeds threshold limits
  - This ignition releases heat, helping remaining fuel (FC) to ignite
  - Lower Tᵢ indicates higher VM content and easier ignition
  - Tᵢ indirectly represents hydrocarbon types present in fuel

- **Peak Temperature (Tₚ)**:

  - Temperature at which fuel combustion rate is highest (kg fuel/min)
  - Maximum rate of mass loss (DTGₘₐₓ) and highest chemical reaction rate
  - Primarily represents fixed carbon combustion
  - Fuels burning at high rates release most energy (kcal/min) at this temperature
  - Low Tₚ with high energy release may indicate highly inflammable fuel (potential hazard)
  - High Tₚ indicates difficulty extracting energy in time-limited industrial combustion

- **Burnout Temperature (Tf)**:
  - Temperature where combustion is nearly complete
  - Residual fuel is minimal and combustion rate drops below 1%/min
  - Highly flammable hydrocarbons complete combustion at lower temperatures
  - Slowly reacting hydrocarbons require more time for combustion

### Practical Implications

- **Combustion Profile Significance**:
  - Tᵢ, Tₚ, Tf, and DTGₘₐₓ collectively represent hydrocarbon/combustible types in fuel
  - High Tᵢ causes ignition difficulties in actual boilers
  - High Tf results in delayed combustion and potentially incomplete burning
  - High DTGₘₐₓ releases most energy in short time, potentially causing excessive temperatures
  - May damage boiler or other combustor components

## Boiler Design and Fuel Consistency

- **Burning Profile Variations**:

  - Each coal/biomass has a unique burning profile
  - Boiler design specifications are based on these burning profiles:
    - Dimensions
    - Temperature profile / Fireball characteristics
    - Location of boiler tubes

- **Blended Fuel Considerations**:

  - For blended fuels (coal/coal or coal/biomass), variations in burning profile parameters affect:
    - Fireball behavior
    - Emission characteristics

- **Coal Variability Challenges**:

  - Coal properties vary even within the same mine:
    - Day-to-day variations
    - Source-to-source differences
  - For optimal performance, TGA/DTG profiles should be consistent across coal supplies
  - Variations can cause boiler problems:
    - Unburned carbon
    - Excessive temperatures
    - Ash melting
  - Acceptable variations should be limited to approximately ±5-10°C

- Coal particles need to grinded at desirable diameter/ volume and should have required density so that they remain in air for sufficient time to ensure complete combustion.
- if not settling velocity increases and particles get less residence time and incomplete combustion occurs.
- Coal/biomass particle density & heat release rate controls the temperature profile inside the boiler.
- Early ignition results in wider and low temperature fire ball.
- Delayed combustion, higher peak combustion rate results in concentrated fireball: overheating of tube, NOx formation etc.
