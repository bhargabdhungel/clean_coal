# Coal Combustion Fundamentals

## Basic Combustion Chemistry

- **Combustion Process**:
  - Involves chemical reactions between coal hydrocarbons and oxygen
  - Typically uses air (21% O₂ by volume, 23% by weight) as oxygen source
  - Approximately 80% of air is nitrogen (non-reactive)
  - Combustion is exothermic (releases heat energy)

- **Energy Release Mechanism**:
  - Energy stored in chemical bonds (C-C, C-H, C-O, C-S) is released
  - Products (CO₂, H₂O) have lower internal bond energy than reactants
  - Energy release measured as Gross Calorific Value (GCV) in kcal/kg
  - Activation energy required to initiate reactions

- **Key Reaction Types**:
  - Complete combustion: CₓHᵧ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
  - Partial combustion: CₓHᵧ + O₂ → CO + H₂O
  - Simplified representation: C + O₂ → CO₂
  - Additional reactions occur with S, N, P, Cl, producing various oxides

## Combustion Kinetics and Controlling Factors

- **Reaction Rate Variations**:
  - Different coal hydrocarbon structures burn at different rates
  - Reaction rates vary with coal origin, age, and plant source material
  - Same mass (1 kg) of different coals require different time to complete combustion
  - Heat release rate (kcal/min) varies between coals of similar calorific value

- **Influencing Factors**:
  - Mineral matter and inorganic salts modify reaction kinetics
  - Some compounds have catalytic (accelerating) effects
  - Others have inhibitory (slowing) effects
  - Coal maturity affects hydrocarbon composition and reactivity

- **Diffusion-Controlled Combustion**:
  - Initial reaction occurs at coal particle surface
  - Ash layer quickly forms around burning coal
  - O₂ must diffuse inward through ash layer to reach unreacted coal
  - Combustion products (CO₂, H₂O, SO₂) must diffuse outward
  - Reaction rate limited by diffusion through ash layer
  - Rate progressively slows as ash layer thickens

- **Ash Layer Effects**:
  - Critical ash properties affecting combustion:
    - Thickness
    - Porosity
    - Mineral matter composition
  - High-ash coal burns slower and with more difficulty
  - Smaller particles (<75 μm) reduce diffusion limitations

## Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) of Coal

- **TGA Methodology**:
  - Coal heated in oxidative environment (O₂)
  - Temperature increases from ambient to high temperature
  - Typical heating rate: 10°C/min
  - Mass loss measured and recorded continuously
  - Mass loss profile analyzed against temperature

- **Critical Temperature Points**:
  - Tᵢ (Ignition Temperature): Where mass loss rate exceeds 1%/min
  - Tₚ (Peak Temperature): Maximum mass loss rate (DTGₘₐₓ)
  - Tf (Burnout Temperature): Where mass loss rate falls below 1%/min

- **Combustion Sequence**:
  - Moisture loss (~100°C)
  - Volatile matter release (300-400°C)
  - Volatile matter ignition
  - Fixed carbon combustion
  - Burnout phase

- **Temperature Profile Interpretation**:
  - Tᵢ (Ignition Temperature):
    - Lower values indicate higher VM content
    - Easier ignition with lower Tᵢ
    - Indirectly indicates hydrocarbon types
  
  - Tₚ (Peak Temperature):
    - Indicates maximum combustion rate
    - Primarily represents fixed carbon combustion
    - Low Tₚ with high energy release may indicate hazardous fuel
    - High Tₚ indicates difficulty extracting energy quickly
  
  - Tf (Burnout Temperature):
    - Indicates combustion completion
    - Higher values suggest longer combustion time requirements
    - Related to slowly reacting hydrocarbons

- **Industrial Significance**:
  - TGA profiles predict industrial combustion behavior
  - Industrial coal must burn within specific timeframes
  - Heat release must occur in targeted boiler zones
  - Combustion profiles must match boiler design parameters

## Boiler Design and Coal Selection

- **Burning Profile Considerations**:
  - Each coal has unique burning characteristics
  - Boiler design based on specific coal burning profiles:
    - Dimensions
    - Temperature profile
    - Fireball characteristics
    - Tube placement

- **Coal Variability Challenges**:
  - Properties vary between mines and within same mine
  - Day-to-day and source-to-source differences
  - TGA/DTG profiles should remain consistent
  - Acceptable variations limited to ±5-10°C in key temperatures
  - Variations can cause:
    - Unburned carbon
    - Excessive temperatures
    - Ash melting

- **Blended Fuel Effects**:
  - Coal/coal or coal/biomass blends alter burning profiles
  - Changes affect:
    - Fireball behavior
    - Emission characteristics
  - Non-additive properties require testing of actual blends

## Particle Characteristics and Combustion Efficiency

- **Optimal Particle Properties**:
  - Size must match combustion system design
    - Fluidized bed: 2-10 mm
    - Pulverized coal: <75 μm
  - Density must allow proper suspension time
  - Settling velocity affects residence time
  - Insufficient residence time causes incomplete combustion

- **Temperature Profile Effects**:
  - Particle size and density control heat release rates
  - Early ignition creates wider, cooler fireballs
  - Delayed combustion causes concentrated, hotter fireballs
  - Concentrated fireballs can cause:
    - Tube overheating
    - Increased NOₓ formation
    - Equipment damage

- **Design Coal Requirements**:
  - Use coal with properties matching combustor design
  - Reference values available in boiler manufacturer manuals
  - When design coal unavailable, analyze combustion profile of alternatives
  - Combustion characteristics should be measured directly
  - Flue gas composition provides key monitoring data

- **Troubleshooting Indicators**:
  - CO present with no O₂: Secondary air insufficient
  - Both CO and O₂ present: Combustor problems (mixing issues)

## Analytical Limitations and Practical Considerations

- **Coal Characterization Challenges**:
  - Standard tests (proximate, ultimate, GCV) don't identify specific compounds
  - Measures thermal stability (VM, FC) rather than chemical structure
  - Detailed chemical analysis is difficult and costly
  - Heat release rate (kcal/min) more important than total heat content (kcal/kg)

- **Historical Energy Context**:
  - Energy released during combustion was originally captured during photosynthesis
  - Plants converted solar energy to chemical energy in hydrocarbons
  - Enthalpy balance: original reactants to final products plus released heat
