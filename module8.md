# Emission Control Technologies for Coal Combustion

## SOx Emission Control

### Sources and Prevention
- SOx in flue gas originates from sulfur present in fuel
- Control approaches include:
  - **Pre-utilization**: Coal desulfurization using various cleaning methods
  - **During combustion**: Use of limestone during fluidized bed combustion/gasification
  - **Post-combustion**: Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems
  - Blending with low-sulfur fuel to reduce consumption of high-sulfur coal
  - Some industries use high excess air to dilute SOx (total SOx remains the same)

### Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) Systems

#### Classification
- **By process type**:
  - Wet scrubbers
  - Dry scrubbers
  - Spray dryers
  - Dry sorbent injection processes
  - Regenerable processes
  - Circulating fluid-bed and moving-bed scrubbers
  - Combined SO₂/NOx/dust particle removal systems

- **By regeneration**:
  - **Regenerative**: Chemical used to remove SO₂ can be regenerated and used again
  - **Non-regenerative**: Chemical passes to disposal after use

#### Sorbents and Products
- **Common sorbents**:
  - Calcium-based (CaCO₃, CaO)
  - Magnesium-based
  - Potassium or sodium-based
  - Ammonia
  - Seawater

- **Reaction products**:
  - Calcium-based: Forms hydrous calcium sulfate (CaSO₄·2H₂O, gypsum)
  - Ammonia-based: Forms ammonium sulfate [(NH₄)₂SO₄]
    - Provides both sulfur and nitrogen for crops
    - Growing market in fertilizer formulations

#### Wet FGD Technology
- Involves contact of flue gas with solution or slurry for SO₂ removal
- **Regenerative processes**: Recover elemental sulfur or sulfuric acid
- **Non-regenerative processes**: Produce calcium sulfite or calcium sulfate sludge for disposal

#### Dry FGD Technology
- Includes lime/limestone spray drying, dry sorbent injection, and circulating fluidized bed scrubbers
- **Advantages**:
  - Produces dry waste products that are easier to dispose than wet scrubber waste
  - Spray dry scrubbers are second most widely used method for utility coal-fired plants
  - Lower cost compared to wet scrubbing systems

#### Spray Drying Process
- **Sorbents**: Typically lime (CaO) or hydrated lime (Ca(OH)₂)
- **Process flow**:
  - Hot flue gas exits boiler air heater and enters reactor vessel
  - Slurry of lime and recycled solids is atomized/sprayed into absorber
  - Slurry formation: CaO(s) + H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(s) + heat
  - SO₂ absorption reactions:
    - Ca(OH)₂(s) + SO₂(g) → CaSO₃·½H₂O(s) + ½H₂O(v)
    - Ca(OH)₂(s) + SO₃(g) + H₂O(l) → CaSO₄·2H₂O(s)
  - Small alkaline stream prevents corrosion of system walls and pipes

#### Comparison of Wet vs. Dry FGD
- **Dry FGD advantages**:
  - Lower capital and operational costs
  - Lower power consumption and pumping requirements
  - No liquid waste production
  - Waste suitable for landfilling and can be disposed with fly ash
- **Dry FGD disadvantages**:
  - Lower reagent utilization efficiency
  - More expensive than wet FGD for same SO₂ removal performance

## NOx Emission Control

### Formation Mechanism
- NOx generated during combustion by reaction of N₂ and O₂
- Formation increases significantly at temperatures:
  - Above 1000°C: Very low yield
  - Above 1400°C: High yield
- Nitrogen sources: Fuel hydrocarbon (CHNSO) or air (~80% N₂)
- N₂ cannot be removed from combustor; only formation rate can be controlled

### Control Technologies

#### Combustion Modifications
- **Temperature control**: Maintain below 1200-1300°C to reduce formation rate
- **Excess air control**: Precise use of primary and secondary air
- **Flue-gas recirculation**: Return portion of flue gas to combustion chamber to:
  - Help cool the process
  - Maintain peak flame temperatures below critical levels
  - Recycle excess air, allowing for lower fresh air input
- **Oxyfuel combustion**: Use pure O₂ during combustion (costly method)

#### Post-Combustion Treatment
- **Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)**:
  - Ammonia or urea injected and mixed with gases before catalyst chamber
  - Chemical reactions:
    - 2NO + 2NH₃ + ½O₂ → 2N₂ + 3H₂O
    - NO₂ + 2NH₃ + ½O₂ → 1.5N₂ + 3H₂O
    - NO + NO₂ + 2NH₃ → 2N₂ + 3H₂O
  - Optimal temperature range: 357-447°C
  - Can operate as low as 227°C with longer residence time

## Advanced Combustion Technologies

### Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC)
- Metal oxide oxygen carriers transport oxygen from air to fuel
- Avoids direct contact between coal and air
- **Process flow**:
  - In fuel reactor: Fuel oxidized by oxygen carrier to CO₂ and H₂O
  - Pure CO₂ recovered after H₂O condensation
  - Reduced oxygen carrier transported to air reactor
  - In air reactor: Carrier reacts with air and is re-oxidized
  - Exit gas from air reactor contains only N₂ and unreacted O₂
- Still under development

### Oxyfuel Combustion
- Coal/fuel burned in O₂-rich environment with minimal N₂
- **Advantages**:
  - Minimizes NOx formation
  - Flue gas consists mainly of CO₂ and H₂O
  - CO₂ easily captured for industrial use or storage
  - Reduced flue gas volume (75-80% less than air-fired combustion)
  - Easier removal of pollutants (SOx, mercury, fly ash)
  - Greatly reduced NOx production

#### Process Components

## CO₂ Capture and Storage

### Capture Technologies

#### Solvent-based Systems

- **Advantages**: Potential energy savings, waste reduction, process simplification
- **Challenges**: Sorbent durability, capacity, specificity, cost

#### Membrane Separation
