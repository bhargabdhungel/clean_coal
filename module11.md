 coal based power generation
 Pulverized coal combustion (>90% plant) and Fluidized Bed combustion (<10%) is mostly used.
➢ Gasification based plants are very less.
➢ In Pulverized coal combustion units, ROM coal or washery middling is used.
➢ GCV>3500 kcal/kg or ash<45% in coal.
➢ High ash, difficulty in plant operation and cost.
➢ Grinding of coal to -75 m is required, coal handling section (CHP) ends at grinding of coal.
➢ Presently biomass pallets are also mixed with crushed coal and grinded in mill.

 For high ash coal; reject coal, lignite, coal slurry fines, coal washery tailings etc. are used in FBC.
➢ Co firing of other fuels is very easy for FBC: Biomass, municipal solid waste, coke powder etc.
➢ Crushing of coal to -10 mm is required in FBC.
➢ Coal handling section (CHP) ends at crusher, no grinding required.
➢ Typically, bigger plants of 100 MW, in single unit or more are Pulverized fired.
➢ Smaller plants of 5-20-30 MW in single unit are FBC based.
➢ Older plants (installed before 2000), have much lower capacity.
➢ Depending on improvement in technology, newer plants capacity are much bigger.


➢ CHP receive coal from mines, feed size about 1000 mm.
➢ Coal unloaded by wagon Tripler / trucks/ bottom discharge wagon.
➢ All movement of coal through conveyor belts. (Abrasive index is important).
➢ Stored in stockpile or directly feed to CHP for crushing and burning.
➢ Initial crushing to below -50 mm, followed by -12.5/3 mm crushing.
➢ Suitable size screens are also placed.
➢ Crushed coal feed to bunker silo: storage capacity for 12-18 Hr plant operation.
➢ Silos make process from batch to continuous mode.
➢ FBC plant CHP ends here.
➢ Coal is burned in combustor.

➢ Additional unit for pulverized combustor
➢ From silos, coal sent to pulverizer (mill). (HGI is important)
➢ Primary air also given to blow / transport powder coal (-75 m) to combustor.
(particle density is important).
➢ Coal is burned in combustor.
➢ After combustion, Bottom ash, fly ash, flue gas are generated.
➢ They are captured by cyclone separator, ESP, flue gas desulfurizer unit etc. as
required.
➢ Fuel oil is used for initial ignition as well as to maintain the desirable flame
temperature inside boiler.

 Interaction between: Electrical Coils & Magnetic Field: Electricity induced in varying magnetic field.
➢ Turbine: Magnet Rotates and Electricity generates in Electrical Cables: Power Production
➢ We needs to creates rotational movement: Any fluid releasing energy at Turbine Blades.
➢ Fluid should have high Kinetic Energy: to be released at turbine blades and converts it to Rotational
energy, then Electromagnetic energy and finally Electricity.
➢ High temperature steam> Steam turbine> Thermal Power Plant.

Fleming's left hand rule
➢ Interaction between: Electrical Coils & Magnetic Field: Electricity induced in varying magnetic field.
➢ Turbine: Magnet Rotates and Electricity generates in Electrical Cables: Power Production

 Power plant operates at constant output capacity: say 500 MW
➢ Based on design, plant needs constant steam quality (steam temperature and
pressure) and mass (kg/min) to generate desired power.
➢ Steam is used as operating fluid: Medium used to transport energy from combustor
to turbine.
➢ Steam quantity (mass flow rate, kg/min) and quality (pressure & temperature) must
be maintained by the boiler by burring coal at desirable heat release rate.
➢ Coal must be burned properly with desirable heat release rate (kcal/min), GCV if
coal important but coal combustion rate is most important.
➢ Slow coal combustion will not be able to maintain heat release rate requirement.

 Hence pulveriser must grind coal upto -75m within desirable time (hard coal will take
more time for grinding).
➢ Primary air flow rate must be as per design to transport coal particle (with desired density)
to the boiler.
➢ Coal GCV varies with GCV, combustion rate all are correlated and must be as per design.
Model Calculation of coal feed rate:
➢ For 500 MW plant, output is 500 MW; 1 MW = 860,420.814612 kcal/h;
➢ Plant overall efficiency for Rankin cycle, generator etc: say 40%
➢ Heat output required =500 MW/0.40 (in kcal/kg)
➢ Coal GCV: say 5000 kcal/kg
➢ Coal feed rate Heat required/GCV

 For FBC based plants, temperature is about 850-900 OC.
➢ High sulfur coal may be used in FBC unit.
➢ AFT is important in design of pulverized boiler, maximum temperature is decided based on
AFT as well as other parameters.
➢ Super thermal, ultra super thermal plant etc. are based on maximum steam temperature
and pressure used in plant. Mostly based on metallurgical limit of boiler tube material,
combustion technology, grade of coal available etc.
➢ Auxilary power is required for plant operation, running different equipment before plant
generates its own electricity.
➢ SO grid connectivity is must, isolated single plant can not operate.
➢ Electricity peak demand, lean demand, sudden demand etc are important.
➢ Electricity must meet the standard requirement Frequency (50 HZ)


 Inside the boiler, water is converted to steam, at three different sections, economizer,
evaporator and super heater.
➢ Economizer: it is used to increase the feed water temperature from 30 OC to about 100 OC,
using the low temperature heat available inside boiler. Mostly waste heat released from flue
gas is use here.

➢ Evaporator: in this zone, water is vaporized from liquid phase to vapor phase. Only latent heat
of phase change is required, it is significant amount as latent heat is higher than sensible heat.
➢ Superheater: In this zone, steam is super heated from about 100 OC to desirable condition as
per turbine (around 560OC, 200 bar: varied from plant to plant). High temperature flue gas
(~1300 OC) is used for this purpose.

 Any fluid (gas/ vapor/liquid) can be used as working fluid with following quality
parameters.
➢ It must have higher heat transport capacity: to transport energy from boiler to turbine.
➢ So specific heat capacity (Cp), latent heat () etc. must be higher so that with low
temperature difference it can carry more heat.
➢ It must be easily available (to meet the plant demand), cheap, non toxic, environment
friendly, non corrosive etc.
➢ It boiling temperature matches heat transport requirement and turbine profile (low
temperature or high temperature) etc.

 Mostly pure water is used in thermal plant at normal cycle.
➢ Mercury (Hg) was used earlier.
➢ Some organic liquids also used in low temperature Rankin cycle (combined cycle plant).
➢ As water can more heat as steam at high temperature and pressure (please see the
steam table enthalpy data) pressurized water is fed to boiler and converted to steam.
➢ Steam temp vs enthalpy, water must be at high pressure and temperature to transport
desirable energy
➢ Any change in steam pressure/temperature can lead to phase change of water from
vapor to liquid. It is highly undesirable, damage to turbine.
➢ Pump is used to pressurize liquid water and sent to boiler.


➢ Turbine convert kinetic energy available in steam to rotational energy, so that rotor
contaminating armature (electrical cable) rotates with nearby magnetic field.
➢ Due to variations of magnetic field, electricity induced in armature and mechanical energy
is converted to electrical energy.
➢ Produced electricity is further step up , increase voltage (volt) and reduced current (amp)
as per requirement of grid/consumer.
➢ A separate electrical power transmission unit take care of this job

 Purpose of condenser it to recycle back the working fluid from vapor phase to liquid
phase.
➢ It also removed the unused heat from steam to cooling tower/ nearby water body.
➢ Unused steam must be condensed immediately to increase the pressure difference
across turbine to that it rotates at high speed.
➢ Some water as vapor is lost at condenser, so makeup water is added continuously as
working fluid.

As steam with minerals (dissolved salt, chemicals, organic compounds) can be corrosive
at high temperature, water is purified at its best (almost pure H2O, zero TDS).
➢ A separate water treatment plant take care of this.
➢ Nearby big water body is must. River, big size lake etc.
➢ Similarly ash handling section, ESP, cyclone etc are also there for pollution control.


Efficiency of Rankin cycle is decided by thermodynamics:
➢ About 42% to 46% in steam turbine.
➢ Due to other losses in system it is mostly below 35%.
➢ Well proven technology, mostly used worldwide.
- eff overall = n(boiler) * n(cycle) * n(turbine) * n(generator)
= n = 1 - q2/q1


 Auxilary Fuel: Liquid Fuel, Fuel Oil
➢ Auxilary Power Consumption: Electricity consumed in the plant operation
➢ Coal Handling plant (CHP) also consume electricity
➢ Fly ash Utilization: Solid waste, transferred to other consumer/plants
➢ Power Transmission to Grid
➢ Steam Pressure vs Efficiency plot is important
➢ Reheating cycle, medium and low pressure turbine: Based on plant complexity/
simplicity desired, process control aspects.

In may industrial application, heat or steam is also required in their material processing.
➢ In such plant, waste heat or steam release from power generation unit is sent to material
processing section.
➢ Such plant, where fuel is used for both electricity generation as well as heat is called co
generation of heat.
➢ In this way overall energy efficiency of plant is increase and pollution level is reduced.


gas turbine
➢ A gas turbine generate power by burning fuel to create hot gases that rotate the turbine.
➢ It is known Brayton cycle based power production
Initially air compressed by rotor (compressor) and sent to combustor, where fuel is
burned at high temperature and pressure flue gas is generated.
➢ Flue gas is used to rotate the turbine, which is further connected with generator to
produce electricity.
➢ Some of the energy generated is used to operate the compressor.
➢ Coal, liquid fuel, gaseous can be used to produce electricity.
➢ Efficiency is about 30-35%.
➢ Less installation time, cost, quick start and stop are the major advantages.
➢ As mostly operate using liquid/gaseous fuel operating cost is higher.
➢ In combined cycle power generation, two or more power generation cycles are operated
in series to increase the energy efficiency of the plant.
➢ Exhaust energy from one power generation cycle is used in next power generation cycle.
➢ For example: in first power generation, GT cycle is operated, and electricity is generated.
➢ Exhaust flue gas is used further to generate steam and produce electricity using Rankin
cycle. It is known as GT+ST cycle.
➢ Similarly it can be GT+GT or ST+ST or ST+GT etc…
➢ Major advantage is increase in efficiency: GT (200 MW)+ST (100 MW) compared to only
GT 200 MW.
➢ Disadvantage: complex plant operation, increase in investment cost.
➢ Similarly Dual cycle is also used in many ST based plant.

 In IGCC in a single plant coal is used to fulfill multiple purpose
➢ Coal gasification is carried out with removal of different pollutants, recovery of valuable
resources.
➢ GT based power generation
➢ ST based bower generation
➢ Cogeneration of Heat if required.
➢ In IGCC in a single plant coal is used to fulfill multiple purpose
➢ Initially coal is gasified to produce CO, H2, CH4 and other gas mixture (syn gas)
➢ During gasification, recovery/removal of Sulfur is carried out.
➢ After gasified syn gas is purified for removal of H2S, NH3 etc.
➢ Sys gas is used as fuel gas in GT.

 In GT electricity is generated.
➢ Exhaust heat is use to generate steam for ST based power generation.
➢ Produced heat during gasification is used as byproduct-cogeneration of steam or others
application.
➢ In parallel, syn gas also can be used for production of chemicals (coal to chemical).
➢ Major advantage is higher energy efficiency, minimum pollution along with production of
valuable chemicals.
➢ Disadvantage is complex network of energy transfer, higher investment cost, too many
product to handle and marketing challenge.

operational advantage.
➢ Energy efficiency of Rankin cycle is about 42%.
➢ Steam quality is major concerned for power generation, indirectly coal quality and coal
combustion.
➢ IGCC can be use for electricity generation as well for other downstream plants.
➢ Due to operational complexity, IGCC is not so much popular for power generation
although it is cleaner technology compared to Direct combustion methds.
