# Coal Sampling, Size Reduction and Cleaning

## Coal Heterogeneity and Sampling Considerations

- **Distribution Characteristics**:
  - Coal contains extremely heterogeneous distribution of mineral matter and hydrocarbons
  - Proper sampling is critical for accurate analysis
  - Representative samples must account for this variation

## Size Reduction and Liberation

- **Liberation Size Concept**:
  - Size must be reduced until particles can be separated into:
    - High mineral matter particles
    - High hydrocarbon particles
  - This critical size is termed "liberation size"
  - Practical limitations typically prevent reduction below 75 microns
  - Smaller sizes require higher energy consumption
  - Excessive grinding generates more fines, creating handling issues

- **Size Reduction Effects**:
  - Even after crushing to similar sizes, particles may have different distributions of:
    - Mineral matter
    - Hydrocarbons
  - Size reduction to lowest possible size improves separation efficiency

## Coal Cleaning Methods

### Physical Cleaning Processes

- **Density-Based Separation**:
  - Exploits density differences between components:
    - Hydrocarbons: 1.2-1.3 g/cc
    - Mineral matter: 2.6-2.7 g/cc
  - Separation solutions include:
    - Kerosene
    - Tetrachloroethylene
    - Bromoform
    - Zinc chloride solutions
  - Generally, coal with:
    - Lower specific gravity has lower ash content
    - Higher specific gravity has higher ash content

- **Surface Property-Based Separation**:
  - **Hydrophobicity Differences**:
    - Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic (water-repelling)
    - Mineral matter is hydrophilic (water-attracting)
    - Used in froth flotation processes
  - **Surface Charge Characteristics**:
    - Differential charges used in oil agglomeration processes
  - **Chemical Reagent Affinity**:
    - Selective separation based on differential chemical affinities

### Chemical Cleaning Processes

- Utilizes chemical reactions or dissolution processes
- Either hydrocarbons or mineral matter selectively react with specific reagents
- Can target specific impurities not easily removed by physical methods

### Biochemical Cleaning Processes

- Employs microorganisms to selectively remove impurities
- Can be particularly effective for certain sulfur compounds
- Generally slower but potentially more environmentally friendly

## Washability Analysis

- **Purpose and Procedure**:
  - Identifies optimal separation parameters
  - Determines cutoff values for GCV/ash/sulfur
  - Detailed plots prepared to identify cutoff specific gravity

- **Analytical Steps**:
  1. Individual specific gravity fractions are separated
  2. Fractions are washed, dried and analyzed for:
     - Mass percentage
     - Complete coal characterization (proximate analysis, GCV)
     - Additional parameters relevant to end-use

- **Data Presentation**:
  - Tables and plots prepared on:
    - Differential density basis
    - Cumulative basis
  - Analysis focus varies by coal type:
    - Coking coal: Proximate analysis vs. specific gravity most important
    - Non-coking coal: Proximate analysis and GCV vs. specific gravity essential
    - Additional properties (FSI, Caking index) measured for final consideration

## Cleaning Objectives and Implementation

- **Key Goals**:
  - Reduce sulfur content (environmental benefit)
  - Reduce ash content (improves thermal performance)
  - Increase overall resource utilization efficiency

- **Typical Implementation Timing**:
  - After mining operations
  - Before utilization in power plants or other applications

- **Particle Composition Variations**:
  - Same size coal particles can have different:
    - Mineral compositions (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, FeO, K₂O, etc.)
    - Hydrocarbon structures (long chain, branched chain, cyclic, aliphatic, aromatic)
  - These variations affect both cleaning efficiency and end-use performance
