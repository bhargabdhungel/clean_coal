## Coal Sampling and Size Reduction

### Heterogeneity and Sampling

- **Distribution Characteristics**:
  - Distribution of mineral matter and hydrocarbons in coal is extremely heterogeneous
  - Proper sampling of coal is critical for accurate analysis

### Liberation Size

- **Size Reduction Process**:
  - Coal size is reduced until particles can be separated into high mineral matter or high hydrocarbon coal
  - This critical size is called "liberation size"
  - Practical limitations prevent size reduction below 75 microns

## Coal Cleaning Methods

### Types of Cleaning Processes

- **Physical Cleaning**:

  - Based on physical property differences between hydrocarbons and mineral matter:
    - **Density Separation**: Hydrocarbons (1.2-1.3 g/cc) vs. Mineral matter (2.6-2.7 g/cc)
    - **Hydrophobicity**: Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic, mineral matter is hydrophilic (froth flotation)
    - **Surface Charge Characteristics**: Used in oil agglomeration processes
    - **Chemical Reagent Affinity**: Selective separation based on differential affinities

- **Chemical Cleaning**:

  - Utilizes chemical reactions or dissolution processes
  - Either hydrocarbons or mineral matter respond to specific reagents

- **Biochemical Cleaning**:
  - Employs microorganisms to selectively remove impurities

### Cleaning Objectives and Timing

- Focus on reducing both sulfur and ash content
- Cleaning typically performed:
  - After mining
  - Before utilization
- Benefits include reduced environmental impact and better resource utilization

### Washability Analysis

- **Size Reduction Considerations**:

  - Crushed coal of same or similar size may have different distributions of mineral matter and hydrocarbons
  - Size reduction to lowest possible size is required for effective separation
  - Smaller sizes require higher energy consumption and generate more fines

- **Specific Gravity Correlation**:

  - Coal with low specific gravity typically has low ash content
  - Coal with high specific gravity typically has high ash content

- **Process Parameters**:

  - Identification of cutoff values for GCV/ash/sulfur is required
  - Same size coal particles can have different mineral compositions:
    - Various combinations of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, FeO, K₂O, etc.
    - Different hydrocarbon structures (long chain, branched chain, cyclic, aliphatic, aromatic)
  - Various solutions used in gravity separation:
    - Kerosene
    - Tetrachloroethylene
    - Bromoform
    - Zinc chloride solutions

- **Analysis Methods**:

  - Detailed plots are prepared to identify cutoff specific gravity
  - This process is known as washability analysis

- **Analytical Procedure**:
  - Individual specific gravity fractions are washed, dried and analyzed for:
    - Mass percentage
    - Complete coal characterization (proximate analysis, GCV, Caking Index, etc.)
  - Data presentation:
    - Tables and plots prepared on differential density basis and cumulative basis
  - Analysis focus varies by coal type:
    - Coking coal: Proximate analysis vs. specific gravity is most important
    - Non-coking coal: Proximate analysis and GCV analysis vs. specific gravity are essential
    - Additional properties (FSI, Caking index, etc.) measured for final consideration
