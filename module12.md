ucg
n UCG, coal is gasified at the coal mine itself, without mining the coal.
➢ Entire coal mine/ coal seam acts like the reactor for coal gasification.
➢ Water/steam and air or oxygen are injected into a coal seam.
➢ The injected gases react with coal to form a combustible gas.
➢ Product syn gas is collected at the surface, purified/cleaned for impurities and used.
➢ Major cost-saving and simplifying advantage of not requiring the coal to be mined in order to be gasified.
 Injection wells are drilled into an unmined coal seam, and either air or oxygen is injected
into the seam along with water.
➢ The coal face is ignited, and the high temperatures (about 1200°C) from the combustion
and limited oxygen causes nearby coal to partially oxidize into H2, CO, CO2, and some
amounts of CH4, H2S and other gases.
➢ These products flow to the surface through one or more production wells located ahead of
the combustion zone.
➢ As the face is burned and an area depleted, the operation is moved to follow the seam

Site selection is paramount to a successful UCG project.
➢ The characteristics of the coal seam, the permeability and fault structure of the local strata
and the geology and hydrogeology of the area which surrounds the target coal seam must
be fully understood.
➢ This requires the drilling of pilot bore holes to coal seam depth for coring and seam
characterization, and a good quality seismic survey (preferably 3D) of the whole area.
➢ Modelling of the hydrogeology will also be required to meet most countries groundwater
requirements.

 Seam thickness gasification rate decreases and heat value increases with increase in
seam thickness.
➢ Seams >1.3 m thick are considered satisfactory but coal seams with a thickness >2 m are
preferred for long tunnel, large section technology
➢ Coal type: all ranks from lignite to anthracite can be gasified.
➢ Low rank coals are the easiest to gasify but UG trials have been successfully carried out
elsewhere in anthracites, i.e. The highest rank coals.
➢ Produced syn gas needs to be cleaned from H2S, NH3 and other gases. After this

 As gasification occurs inside the coal mines, different coal mining activities, coal handling
etc. are not required to get syn gas.
➢ As a result, UCG may save many other environmental pollution originated from coal
mines.
➢ For starting coal mining activities, land requirement and other infrastructure related coal
can be avoided without impacting coal utilization.
➢ There are several coal mines, where mining activities are extremely difficult due to soil
characteristics, rock properties, adsorbed gases inside coal, nearby forest etc., in such
cases UCG is very good alternative.

 Its infrastructure development is too much costly.
➢ If rocks are faulty, syn gas may come out from different locations, extremely hazardous
condition may happen.
➢ Also supplied heat through steam may be adsorbed by the rocks and other complexity
may arrive.
➢ Drilling in horizontal direction is difficult in many cases.
➢ Ground water may gets contaminated.
➢ Land sliding due to coal extraction, needs geological information about the land /
soil/rock characteristics.


coal bed methane

Coal Bed Methane (CBM), an unconventional source of natural gas is now considered as an
alternative source for augmenting India’s energy resource.
➢ The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal.
➢ It is called 'sweet gas' because of its lack of H2S.
➢ The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining,
where it presents a serious safety risk.
➢ CBM is gas which is created during the formation of coal and is trapped within a coal seam
by formation water.

CBM is chemically identical to other sources of gas, but is produced by non-conventional
methods.
➢ CBM is generally more than 95% methane and is often marketed as being “green” as it
contains no sulphur compounds such as H2S.
➢ CBM, a hydrocarbon (CH4) in gaseous form has its origin in the coalification process
occurring over a period of millions of years out of accumulated plant material.
➢ The methane is in a near-liquid state, lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the
matrix).

 The open fractures in the coal (called the cleats) can also contain free gas or can be
saturated with water.
➢ Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs, CBM contains very little heavier
hydrocarbons such as propane or butane, and no natural-gas condensate.
➢ Coal bed gas contains a variety of constituents like CH4, CO2, N2, H2O, C2H6 and other
hydrocarbons, but methane gas is found in high concentrations in most underground coal
seams. That’s why the term “Coal Bed Methane” is used.
➢ It often contains up to a few percent CO.
➢ CBM grew out of venting methane from coal seams

Some coal beds have long been known to be "gassy," and as a safety measure,
boreholes were drilled into the seams from the surface, and the methane
allowed to vent before mining.
➢ Intrinsic properties of coal as found in nature determine the amount of gas that
can be recovered.
➢ It is trapped in coal bed and released during and after mining when it pressure
is released.
➢ The amount of methane present in coal seams increases with rank of coal and
depth of coal seams.
➢ CBM is a versatile source of energy in that it can be readily stored and
transformed into alternative form of energy such as electricity, etc.

➢ To extract the gas, a steel-encased hole is drilled into the coal seam 100 to 1,500
metres (330 to 4,920 ft) below ground.
➢ As the pressure within the coal seam declines due to natural production or the
pumping of water from the coal bed, both gas and produced water come to the
surface through tubing.
➢ Then the gas is sent to a compressor station and into natural gas pipelines.
➢ The produced water is either reinjected into isolated formations, released into
streams, used for irrigation, or sent to evaporation ponds.
➢ The water typically contains dissolved solids such as sodium
bicarbonate and chloride but varies depending on the formation geology.

 Coalbed methane wells often produce at lower gas rates than conventional reservoirs,
typically peaking at near 300,000 cubic feet (8,500 m3) per day (about 0.100 m³/s), and
can have large initial costs.
➢ The production profiles of CBM wells are typically characterized by a "negative decline"
in which the gas production rate initially increases as the water is pumped off and gas
begins to desorb and flow. A dry CBM well is similar to a standard gas well.

 Typically, coal suitable for CBM development has the following characteristics:
➢ High gas content: 15 m3 – 30 m3 per ton is typical.
➢ Good permeability: 30 mD – 50 mD is typical.
➢ Shallow: Coal seams are less than 1,000 m in depth.
➢ The pressure at greater depths is often too high to allow gas flow even when the
seam has been completely dewatered. This is because the high pressure causes the
cleat structure to close, reducing permeability.
➢ Coal rank: Most CBM projects produce gas from Bituminous coals, but it can be
possible to access gas in Anthracite

 The prognosticated CBM resources in the country are about 92 TCF (2600 BCM) in 12
states of India.
➢ Government of India has formulated CBM policy in 1997 wherein CBM being Natural
Gas is explored and exploited under the provisions of OIL Fields (Regulation &
Development) Act 1948 (ORD Act 1948) and Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959
(P&NG Rules 1959) administered by Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas
(MOP&NG).
➢ The Gondwana sediments of eastern India host the bulk of India’s coal reserves and
all the current CBM producing blocks.

The vast majority of the best prospective areas for CBM development are in eastern
India, situated in Damodar valley and Son valley.
➢ CBM projects exist in Raniganj South, Raniganj East and Raniganj North areas in the
Raniganj coalfield, the Parbatpur block in Jharia coalfield and the East and west Bokaro
coalfields.
➢ Son valley includes the Sonhat North and Sohagpur East and West blocks.
➢ Currently, commercial production has commenced from Raniganj South CBM block.

India is one of the prominent emerging players in the area of CBM market with as many
as 6 to 7 CBM fields are either producing or are on the verge of production.
➢ The estimated domestic production from all CBM fields for the year 2017-2018 is 1 BCM
and will rise substantially in the forthcoming years.
➢ Thus CBM is expected to contribute 5% to 8% of India's gas production by next year.
➢ India houses the world's fourth-largest coal reserves.
➢ The country has identified 26,000 square km of area for CBM operation with total
estimated CBM Resources of 2,600 billion cubic meters (91.8 TCF).


coal mine methane
-  Methane, the principal component of natural gas, is often present in deep coal seams and
is a safety hazard to miners because it is explosive in concentrations ranging from 5 to 15
percent in air. Such methane is known as coal mine methane (CMM).
➢ CMM refers to methane released from the coal and the surrounding rock strata due to
mining activities.
➢ Although CMM is similar to CBM, a subset of the methane found in coal seams, it refers
specifically to the methane found within mining areas, while CBM refers to methane in
coal seams that will never be mined or very difficult to mine.
➢ In underground mines, CMM can create an explosive hazard to mine workers, it is
removed through ventilation and degasification systems.

➢As CMM would be released during mining activities, recovery and use of CMM
are considered essential for mine safety and emissions avoidance.
➢In abandoned mines (AMM) and surface mines, methane can also escape to the
atmosphere through natural fissures or other diffuse sources.
➢Gassy underground coal mines employ large-scale ventilation systems to move
fresh air into the mine.
➢These systems dilute methane released into the mine workings as coal is
extracted and remove the gas from the mine, thereby maintaining safe working
conditions.
➢In-mine methane concentrations must be maintained well below the lower
explosive limit, so ventilation air exhausts contain very dilute concentrations of
methane (typically less than 1% and often less than 0.5%)


-  However, because mine exhaust flow rates are so high, ventilation air methane (VAM)
constitutes the largest source of methane emissions at most mines.
➢ Emissions of VAM waste a clean energy resource and contribute significant global
greenhouse gas emissions.
➢ Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential more than 25
times that of carbon dioxide.
➢ Deploying technologies that destroy VAM emissions or convert VAM into useful forms
of energy (such as electricity and heat) can yield substantial greenhouse gas emission
reductions.
➢ Depends upon the gassiness of coal mine
➢ Gas concentration may vary impacting the quality of feed into power plant
➢ Challenges exist in commercialization of VAM/CMM

CMM and AMM are the major cause of different types of accidents in coal mine.
➢ Gassy coal mines needs removal or extraction of methane before any equipment
/person can go there.
➢ It is extremely fire hazard if concentration is on higher side.
➢ It can replace air/O2 in mine and causes shortage of O2.
➢ Many coal mine accidents are originated from CMM/AMM.
