# Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) and Coal Bed Methane (CBM)

## Underground Coal Gasification (UCG)

- In UCG, coal is gasified at the coal mine itself, without mining the coal
- Entire coal mine/coal seam acts like the reactor for coal gasification
- Water/steam and air or oxygen are injected into a coal seam
- The injected gases react with coal to form a combustible gas
- Product syngas is collected at the surface, purified/cleaned for impurities and used
- Major cost-saving and simplifying advantage of not requiring the coal to be mined in order to be gasified

### UCG Process

- Injection wells are drilled into an unmined coal seam, and either air or oxygen is injected into the seam along with water
- The coal face is ignited, and the high temperatures (about 1200°C) from the combustion and limited oxygen causes nearby coal to partially oxidize into H₂, CO, CO₂, and some amounts of CH₄, H₂S and other gases
- These products flow to the surface through one or more production wells located ahead of the combustion zone
- As the face is burned and an area depleted, the operation is moved to follow the seam

### Site Selection for UCG

Site selection is paramount to a successful UCG project:
- The characteristics of the coal seam, the permeability and fault structure of the local strata and the geology and hydrogeology of the area which surrounds the target coal seam must be fully understood
- This requires the drilling of pilot bore holes to coal seam depth for coring and seam characterization, and a good quality seismic survey (preferably 3D) of the whole area
- Modeling of the hydrogeology will also be required to meet most countries' groundwater requirements

### Coal Seam Requirements for UCG

- **Seam thickness**: Gasification rate decreases and heat value increases with increase in seam thickness
  - Seams >1.3 m thick are considered satisfactory 
  - Coal seams with a thickness >2 m are preferred for long tunnel, large section technology
- **Coal type**: All ranks from lignite to anthracite can be gasified
  - Low rank coals are the easiest to gasify
  - UG trials have been successfully carried out elsewhere in anthracites (highest rank coals)
- Produced syngas needs to be cleaned from H₂S, NH₃ and other gases

### Advantages of UCG

- As gasification occurs inside the coal mines, different coal mining activities, coal handling etc. are not required to get syngas
- UCG may save many other environmental pollution originated from coal mines
- For starting coal mining activities, land requirement and other infrastructure related to coal can be avoided without impacting coal utilization
- UCG is a very good alternative for coal mines where mining activities are extremely difficult due to:
  - Soil characteristics
  - Rock properties
  - Adsorbed gases inside coal
  - Nearby forest/protected areas

### Challenges in UCG

- Infrastructure development is too costly
- If rocks are faulty, syngas may escape from different locations, creating extremely hazardous conditions
- Supplied heat through steam may be absorbed by the rocks causing inefficiencies
- Drilling in horizontal direction is difficult in many cases
- Ground water may get contaminated
- Land subsidence due to coal extraction requires geological information about the land/soil/rock characteristics

## Coal Bed Methane (CBM)

Coal Bed Methane (CBM) is an unconventional source of natural gas now considered as an alternative source for augmenting energy resources:
- The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal
- It is called 'sweet gas' because of its lack of H₂S
- The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining, where it presents a serious safety risk
- CBM is gas which is created during the formation of coal and is trapped within a coal seam by formation water

### Characteristics of CBM

- CBM is chemically identical to other sources of gas, but is produced by non-conventional methods
- Generally more than 95% methane and is often marketed as being "green" as it contains no sulfur compounds such as H₂S
- CBM (CH₄) in gaseous form has its origin in the coalification process occurring over millions of years from accumulated plant material
- The methane is in a near-liquid state, lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the matrix)
- The open fractures in the coal (called the cleats) can also contain free gas or can be saturated with water
- Unlike natural gas from conventional reservoirs, CBM contains very little heavier hydrocarbons such as propane or butane, and no natural-gas condensate
- Coal bed gas contains a variety of constituents like CH₄, CO₂, N₂, H₂O, C₂H₆ and other hydrocarbons, but methane is found in high concentrations in most underground coal seams
- It often contains up to a few percent CO
- CBM grew out of venting methane from coal seams for mine safety

### CBM Formation and Entrapment

- Some coal beds have long been known to be "gassy," and as a safety measure, boreholes were drilled into the seams from the surface to vent methane before mining
- Intrinsic properties of coal as found in nature determine the amount of gas that can be recovered
- It is trapped in coal bed and released during and after mining when pressure is released
- The amount of methane present in coal seams increases with rank of coal and depth of coal seams
- CBM is a versatile source of energy that can be readily stored and transformed into alternative forms of energy such as electricity

### CBM Extraction Process

- To extract the gas, a steel-encased hole is drilled into the coal seam 100 to 1,500 meters (330 to 4,920 ft) below ground
- As the pressure within the coal seam declines due to natural production or the pumping of water from the coal bed, both gas and produced water come to the surface through tubing
- The gas is sent to a compressor station and into natural gas pipelines
- The produced water is either:
  - Reinjected into isolated formations
  - Released into streams
  - Used for irrigation
  - Sent to evaporation ponds
- The water typically contains dissolved solids such as sodium bicarbonate and chloride, but varies depending on the formation geology

### CBM Production Characteristics

- Coalbed methane wells often produce at lower gas rates than conventional reservoirs, typically peaking at near 300,000 cubic feet (8,500 m³) per day (about 0.100 m³/s)
- Can have large initial costs
- The production profiles of CBM wells are typically characterized by a "negative decline" in which the gas production rate initially increases as the water is pumped off and gas begins to desorb and flow
- A dry CBM well is similar to a standard gas well

### Coal Characteristics Suitable for CBM Development

Typically, coal suitable for CBM development has the following characteristics:
- **High gas content**: 15 m³ – 30 m³ per ton is typical
- **Good permeability**: 30 mD – 50 mD is typical
- **Shallow depth**: Coal seams are less than 1,000 m in depth
  - The pressure at greater depths is often too high to allow gas flow even when the seam has been completely dewatered
  - This is because the high pressure causes the cleat structure to close, reducing permeability
- **Coal rank**: Most CBM projects produce gas from Bituminous coals, but it can be possible to access gas in Anthracite

### CBM Resources in India

- The prognosticated CBM resources in India are about 92 TCF (2600 BCM) in 12 states
- Government of India formulated CBM policy in 1997 wherein CBM, being Natural Gas, is explored and exploited under the provisions of:
  - OIL Fields (Regulation & Development) Act 1948 (ORD Act 1948)
  - Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959 (P&NG Rules 1959)
  - Administered by Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MOP&NG)
- The Gondwana sediments of eastern India host the bulk of India's coal reserves and all the current CBM producing blocks

### CBM Projects in India

- The vast majority of the best prospective areas for CBM development are in eastern India, situated in Damodar Valley and Son Valley
- CBM projects exist in:
  - Raniganj South, Raniganj East and Raniganj North areas in the Raniganj coalfield
  - The Parbatpur block in Jharia coalfield
  - The East and West Bokaro coalfields
- Son Valley includes the Sonhat North and Sohagpur East and West blocks
- Commercial production has commenced from Raniganj South CBM block
- India is one of the prominent emerging players in the CBM market with 6-7 CBM fields either producing or on the verge of production
- The estimated domestic production from all CBM fields for 2017-2018 was 1 BCM and was expected to rise substantially
- CBM was expected to contribute 5% to 8% of India's gas production
- India houses the world's fourth-largest coal reserves
- The country has identified 26,000 square km of area for CBM operation with total estimated CBM Resources of 2,600 billion cubic meters (91.8 TCF)

## Coal Mine Methane (CMM)

- Methane, the principal component of natural gas, is often present in deep coal seams and is a safety hazard to miners because it is explosive in concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 percent in air
- CMM refers to methane released from the coal and the surrounding rock strata due to mining activities
- Although CMM is similar to CBM, it refers specifically to the methane found within mining areas, while CBM refers to methane in coal seams that will never be mined or are very difficult to mine
- In underground mines, CMM can create an explosive hazard to mine workers and is removed through ventilation and degasification systems

### CMM Safety and Recovery

- As CMM would be released during mining activities, recovery and use of CMM are considered essential for mine safety and emissions avoidance
- In abandoned mines (AMM) and surface mines, methane can also escape to the atmosphere through natural fissures or other diffuse sources
- Gassy underground coal mines employ large-scale ventilation systems to move fresh air into the mine
- These systems dilute methane released into the mine workings as coal is extracted and remove the gas from the mine, maintaining safe working conditions
- In-mine methane concentrations must be maintained well below the lower explosive limit, so ventilation air exhausts contain very dilute concentrations of methane (typically less than 1% and often less than 0.5%)

### Ventilation Air Methane (VAM)

- Because mine exhaust flow rates are so high, ventilation air methane (VAM) constitutes the largest source of methane emissions at most mines
- Emissions of VAM waste a clean energy resource and contribute significant global greenhouse gas emissions
- Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential more than 25 times that of carbon dioxide
- Deploying technologies that destroy VAM emissions or convert VAM into useful forms of energy (such as electricity and heat) can yield substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions

### Challenges with CMM/VAM

- Gas concentration depends upon the gassiness of coal mine
- Gas concentration may vary, impacting the quality of feed into power plants
- Challenges exist in commercialization of VAM/CMM
- CMM and AMM are major causes of different types of accidents in coal mines
- Gassy coal mines need removal or extraction of methane before any equipment/person can enter
- It is an extreme fire hazard if concentration is on the higher side
- It can replace air/O₂ in mine and cause oxygen deficiency
- Many coal mine accidents originate from CMM/AMM
