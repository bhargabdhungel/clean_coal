# Coal Gasification

## Basic Principles

- Gasification is the process of converting solid fuel (coal or similar) to gaseous form (mixture of CO, H₂, CH₄, CO₂, N₂ etc.)
- Produced gases have good fuel value, may be used as gaseous fuel
- Once coal is converted to gaseous fuel, it has all the advantages of being gaseous fuel compared to heterogeneous solid fuel (coal)
- It is partial combustion of coal, providing 25-40% of O₂ required for combustion
- Steam also can be added during this reaction
- Product gas is known as synthesis gas or syngas (Mixture of N₂+CO) along with other gases such as H₂, CO₂, CH₄ and water vapor etc.

### Gasification Components
- **Fuel**: Coal, coke, biomass, lignite etc. as available and suitable
- **Reactants**: Air, O₂, CO and Steam (H₂O)
- **Products**: CO, H₂, CH₄, CO₂ and water vapor

### Basic Reactions
```
C + 0.5O₂ = CO
C + H₂O = CO + H₂
```

## Gasification Process

- Gasification is a partial oxidation process
- The term partial oxidation means that lesser amount of oxygen is used in gasification than would be required for combustion (i.e., burning or complete oxidation) of the same amount of fuel
- During gasification, the coal is blown through with oxygen and steam, while also being heated (and in some cases pressurized)
- During the reactions, oxygen and water molecules oxidize the coal and produce a gaseous mixture of CO₂, CO, water vapor and H₂ or similar gases
- Some by-products like tar, phenols, etc. are also possible end products, depending on the specific gasification technology utilized and temperature of exit gas
- This process has also been conducted in-situ within natural coal seams, referred to as underground coal gasification

### Chemical Process
- The chemistry of gasification is quite complex and is accomplished through a series of physical transformations and chemical reactions within the gasifier
- In a gasifier, the carbonaceous feedstock undergoes several different processes and/or reactions
- Some of the major chemical reactions are known as:
  - Dehydration
  - Pyrolysis/devolatilization
  - Oxidation/combustion
  - Reduction/gasification
  - Water gas/shift reaction
  - Methanation

## Advantages of Gasification

- Coal converted to gaseous fuel: easy to transport through pipelines
- Ash is disposed at the source; ease to landfilling, saving in transportation cost
- Better combustion efficiency for syngas
- Production of fuel for use in electric power generation units
- Generation of fuel gas (low to medium heating value) for industrial purposes

## Gasification Reactions

## Reaction Sequence

- As long as oxygen is in excess, carbon dioxide is formed by reaction (i):
  - C (s) + O₂ → CO₂ (Exothermic) ΔH~ -97,000 kcal
  - Initially CO and further CO₂
- Then undergoes reduction into CO by Boudouard reaction (ii), which is most important reaction controlling the gasification process:
  - C(s) + CO₂ ⟷ 2CO (Endothermic) ΔH~ +38,270 kcal
  - This is an endothermic reaction. Its equilibrium constant increases with rise in temperature
  - The content of CO in the equilibrium mixture of CO and CO₂ at 1 atm increases sharply above 500°C
  - At around 1000°C the CO % is nearly around 99.6%

### Secondary Reactions
- After the gases leave the fuel bed, the CO partly dissociates into CO₂ and C:
  - 2CO → CO₂ + C ΔH~ -38,270 kcal
  - This is reversal of Boudouard reaction and is known as Neumann reversal reaction
- Produced gas contains CO, CO₂, H₂, CH₄, N₂ and O₂
- Exact gas composition depends on the reaction conditions such as pressure, temperature, availability of O₂, coal composition etc.
- Purpose of gasification is to generate syngas not heat release
- Reactions are conducted/controlled to increase the yield of gas like CO or H₂

## Reaction Parameters

- As it is chemical reaction between coal and gas (air/O₂/H₂O) all the reaction parameters related to coal combustion will be same
- Concepts of ash layer, effects of VM, FC, porosity, ash composition, AFT, ignition temperature etc. will be there
- As reactants (source of coal) and products are different, reaction kinetics may not be exactly same every time but similar
- Overall coal conversion may not be same every time

## Role of Steam and Air

- If only air is used, H₂ gas concentration in product is less
- The demerits of air blown gas producer are removed by using steam along with air, which enriches the hydrogen percentage in producer gas
- Additional Water-Gas Reactions take place:
  ```
  C + H₂O(g) → CO + H₂ (Endothermic)       ΔH ~ +28,440 kcal (iv)
  C + 2H₂O(g) → CO₂ + 2H₂ (Endothermic)    ΔH ~ +18,600 kcal (v)
  ```
- The reaction (iv) is water gas reaction and is active at and above 1000°C, while reaction (v) predominates between 500-600°C
- Both the reactions are endothermic, utilize heat liberated by carbon in the bed to potential heat in the combustible gases formed viz., CO and H₂
- As the CO₂ is undesired component of the product gas, reaction (v) should be suppressed by maintaining high temperature and choosing proper amount of steam

### Benefits of Steam Addition
- Total combustible gas components like CO, H₂ and CH₄ increased in product gas
- Inert gas content such as N₂ and CO₂ decreased
- Calorific value of product gas improves
- A part of sensible heat liberated by combustion of carbon is used for conversion of H₂ producing reaction
- In case of only air, bed temperature is extremely high, ash melting/fusion probability is reduced if H₂O is used

### Water Gas Shift Reaction
```
CO + H₂O(g) → CO₂ + H₂            ΔH ~ -9,840 kcal (vi)
```

### Additional Methanation Reactions
```
C + 2H₂ → CH₄                      ΔH ~ -20,840 kcal (vii)
CO + 3H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O              (viii)
```
- Reaction (viii) is made to take place when the aim is to maximize the concentration of methane by maintaining the ratio of CO to H₂ as 3:1

## Other Gaseous Products

- In the low-oxygen, reducing environment of the gasifier, most of the feedstock's sulfur converts to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), with a small amount forming carbonyl sulfide (COS)
- Nitrogen chemically bound in the feed generally converts to gaseous nitrogen (N₂), with some ammonia (NH₃), and a small amount forming hydrogen cyanide (HCN)
- Chlorine is primarily converted to hydrogen chloride (HCl)
- In general, the quantities of sulfur, nitrogen, and chloride in the fuel are sufficiently small that they have a negligible effect on the main syngas components of H₂ and CO
- Trace elements associated with both organic and inorganic components in the feed, such as mercury, arsenic and other heavy metals, appear in the various ash and slag fractions, as well as in gaseous emissions, and need to be removed from the syngas prior to further use

## Role of Coal Properties

- Coal reactivity is the main parameter to decide the gasification kinetics
- Mineral matter, VM, FC etc. all play important roles during gasification
- As it is chemical reactions among hydrocarbons present in coal and reactant gases (O₂, CO, H₂, H₂O etc.), reactions at individual components occur
- Mineral Matter composition also has negative/positive role during such chemical reaction
- All the reactions are like coal combustion reaction: Simply reactions between hydrocarbons and reactant gases in presence of impurities (MM)
- Hence reaction kinetics and product gas composition will vary depending on coal composition, reaction conditions etc.

### Role of Moisture
- Fuel Used: Coal, lignite, coke, biomass, municipal waste etc.
- Fixed-bed gasifiers can accommodate moisture contents of up to 35 percent, provided the ash content is not in excess of about 10 percent
- Pre-drying may be performed if the moisture and ash contents are above these amounts
- Entrained-flow or fluidized-bed gasifiers require the moisture content to be reduced to less than about 5 percent by drying to improve coal handleability
- In the entrained-flow system, the residual moisture contributes to the gasification steam but requires heat to evaporate it

### Role of Ash
- Chemical composition may affect reaction kinetics, Ash Fusion, Heat transfer, temperature control inside reactor
- Ash should be kept at a minimum, since provisions must be made for introducing it to, and withdrawing it from the system, provisions that add to the complexity and cost of the overall system
- Ash can be used as a heat transfer medium, either by its flow countercurrent to the products of gasification and gasifying agents in fixed-bed systems or by provisions in entrained-flow systems
- In fixed-bed systems, ash accumulates at the base of the fuel bed and is withdrawn by a mechanical grate if un-fused or through a tap hole if it is a liquid slag
- In the entrained-flow system, it is removed as a liquid slag

#### Ash Fusion Temperature
- The ash fusion temperature is a measure of when the ash will melt and transform from a solid to liquid state
- This temperature is an important parameter for the design and operation of gasification systems:
  - For systems that operate below the ash fusion temperature to avoid fusion, sintering, or clinkering of the ash
  - For systems that operate above the ash fusion temperature to promote slag production
- Another important ash characteristic is the relationship between temperature and ash viscosity, since it is the flow characteristics of the slag that are critical

#### Ash in Different Systems
- In fluidized-bed systems, the ash is mixed with the char, and the ash is separated either by sintering and agglomeration of the ash or circulation from the bed through a fully entrained combustor to melt and separate the ash as a liquid slag
- Fluidized-bed and entrained flow gasifiers tend to have higher losses of carbon in the ash than the fixed-bed systems
- Ash constituents are important in the selection of materials of construction, particularly in slagging combustors
- In addition, proper ash composition, or its chemical manipulation through the addition of fluxing agents, is necessary for desirable slagging operations

### Role of Volatile Matter (VM)
- The volatile matter from the coal can add to the products of gasification without incurring steam decomposition or oxygen consumption
- The volatile matter, which can vary from less than 5 percent (on a moist, ash-free basis) for anthracite to over 50 percent for subbituminous coal or lignites, can consist of carbon oxides, hydrogen, and traces of nitrogen compounds
- The volatile matter composition, the type of coal, and the conditions under which the volatile matter is driven off all affect the nature of the residual fixed carbon or char that remains
- Composition of VM may add impurity (gases) in the product gas if not gasified properly

### Role of Fixed Carbon (FC)
- The nature of the fixed carbon, which is the major component of the char after the moisture and volatile matter is driven off, is important to the performance of the gasifier and can vary physically and chemically
- Properties such as density, structure, friability/strength, and reactivity depend primarily on the original coal, but they are influenced by the pressure, the rate at which the coal is heated, and its final temperature
- Caking Tendencies: The coal's caking tendencies—strongly caking and swelling, weakly caking, and noncaking—must be considered during the design of the gasifier process
- Some gasifiers can be designed to handle caking and swelling coals, but others will require the coal to be pretreated

## Scope of Gasification

### Advantages
- Wide variety of coal can be used to generate syngas—a gaseous fuel
- Multiple fuels can be co-gasified in one reactor
- Unused coal/inferior quality coal can be used
- Product gases can be used for power generation
- Advantage of gaseous fuel from solid fuel-coal
- Syngas can be used in different industries
- Can be used in iron ore reduction: replacement of coke; known as direct reduced iron (DRI) method
- If individual gases are separated; CO, H₂, CH₄ etc., can have higher market value
- H₂ as clean fuel for fuel cell and other applications

### Applications
- Syngas can be transported through pipeline/tankers etc. without transporting mineral matter/ash
- Ash can be disposed at source
- Production of Hydrogen gas is possible—only hydrogen generation methods from hydrocarbons
- Coal to chemicals—Fischer-Tropsch chemical reaction
- CO, H₂, CH₄ etc. can be used for synthesis of different organic chemicals (coal to chemicals)
- Coal to methanol and other chemicals

### Challenges
- Coal properties vary from day to day or year to year, difficult to get design coal
- Gas yield may vary if source coal/feedstock changes—difficult to maintain product quality
- Some amount of heat is wasted during gasification
