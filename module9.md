coal gasification

Gasification is the process of converting solid fuel (coal or similar) to gaseous form
(mixture of CO, H2, CH4, CO2, N2 etc.).
➢ Produced gases have good fuel value, may be used as gaseous fuel.
➢ Once coal is converted to gaseous fuel, it has all the advantages of being gaseous fuel
compared to heterogeneous solid fuel (coal).
➢ It is partial combustion of coal, providing 25-40% of O2 required for combustion.


Steam also can be added during this reaction.
➢ Product gas is known as synthesis gas or syn gas (Mixture of N2+CO) along with other
gases such as H2, CO2, CH4 and water vapour etc.
➢ Fuel: Coal, coke, biomass, lignite etc. as available and suitable
➢ Reactant: Air, O2, CO and Steam (H2O)
➢ Products : CO, H2, CH4, CO2 and water vapour
C+0.5O2=CO C+H2O=CO+H2



Gasification is a partial oxidation process.
➢ The term partial oxidation is a relative term which simply means that lesser amount
of oxygen is used in gasification than would be required for combustion (i.e.,
burning or complete oxidation) of the same amount of fuel.
➢ During gasification, the coal is blown through with oxygen and steam, while also
being heated (and in some cases pressurized).
➢ During the reactions, oxygen and water molecules oxidize the coal and produce a
gaseous mixture of CO2, CO, water vapour and H2 or similar gases
➢ Some by-products like tar, phenols, etc. are also possible end products, depending
on the specific gasification technology utilized and temperature of exit gas.
➢ This process has also been conducted in-situ within natural coal seams
referred to as underground coal gasification.

The chemistry of gasification is quite complex and is accomplished through a series of
physical transformations and chemical reactions within the gasifier.
➢ In a gasifier, the carbonaceous feedstock undergoes several different processes and/or
reactions.
➢ Some of the major chemical reactions are known as Dehydration, Pyrolysis/
devolatilization, Oxidation/combustion, Reduction/gasification, Water gas/shift
reaction, Methanation etc.


Coal converted to gaseous fuel: easy to transport through pipelines.
➢ Ash is disposed at the source; ease to landfilling, saving in transportation cost.
➢ Better combustion efficiency for syn gas
➢ Production of fuel for use in electric power generation units.
➢ Generation of fuel gas (low to medium heating value) for industrial purposes.


reactions

Combustion C + ½ O2 → CO ΔH~ -26518 kcal
CO (g) + ½ O2 → CO2 ΔH~ -67610 kcal
C (s) + O2 → CO2 (Exothermic) ΔH~ -97000 kcal (i)

➢ Reduction (Boudouard Reaction) C(s) + CO2 <-> 2CO (Endothermic) ΔH~ +38270 kcal (ii)

➢ Water-Gas Reaction C(s) + H2O(g) <-> CO + H2 (Endothermic) ΔH~ +28440 kcal
C(s) + 2H2O(g) <-> CO2 + 2H2 (Endothermic) ΔH~ +18600 kcal

➢ Water Gas Shift Reaction CO(g) + H2O(g) -> CO2 + H2 ΔH~ -9840 kcal
➢ Methanation reaction C(s) + 2H2 -> CH4 ΔH~ -20840 kcal
This is an exothermic reaction and is therefore largely suppressed by the high
temperature condition of bed.
High pressure favors methanation reaction. CO(g) + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O


➢ As long as oxygen is in excess, carbon dioxide is formed by reaction (i),
C (s) + O2 → CO2 (Exothermic) ΔH~ -97000 kcal (i) Initially CO and further CO2.
➢ Then undergoes reduction into CO by reaction (ii), known as Boudouard reaction
and is most important reaction controlling the gasification process.
Reduction (Boudouard Reaction) C(s) + CO2 <-> 2CO (Endothermic) ΔH~ +38270 kcal (ii)
➢ This is an endothermic reaction. Its equilibrium constant increases with rise in
temperature.
➢ The content of CO in the equilibrium mixture of CO and CO2 at 1 atm increases
sharply above 500oC. At around 1000oC the CO % is nearly around 99.6%.

After the gases leave the fuel bed, the CO partly dissociates into CO2 and C.
2CO CO2 + C ΔH~ -38270 kcal
➢ This is reversal of Boudouard reaction and is known as Neumann reversal reaction.
➢ Produce gas contains CO, CO2, H2, CH4, N2 and O2.
➢ Exact gas composition depends on the reaction conditions such as pressure,
temperature, availability of O2, coal composition etc.
➢ purpose of gasification is to generate syn gas not Heat release,
➢ Reactions are conducted/controlled to increase the yield of gas like CO or H2.


As it is chemical reaction between coal and gas (air/O2/H2O) all the reaction parameters
related to coal combustion will be same.
➢ Concepts of ash layer, effects of VM, FC, porosity, ash composition, AFT, ignition
temperature etc. will be there.
➢ As reactants (source of coal) and products are different, reaction kinetics may not be
exactly same everytime but similar.
➢ Overall coal conversion may not be same every time.


role of steam and air

If only air is used H2 gas concentration in product is less.
➢ The demerits of air blown gas producer are removed by using steam along with
air, which enriches the hydrogen percentage in producer gas.
➢ Additional Water-Gas Reactions take place
C + H2O(g) CO + H2 (Endothermic) ΔH~ +28440 kcal ------(iv)
C + 2H2O(g) CO2 + 2H2 (Endothermic) ΔH~ +18600 kcal -------(v)
➢ The reaction (iv) is water gas reaction and is active at and above 1000oC, while
reaction (v) is predominates between 500-600oC.
➢ Both the reactions are endothermic, utilize heat liberated by carbon in the bed
to potential heat in the combustible gases formed viz., CO and H2 .
➢ As the CO2 is undesired component of the product gas, reaction (v) should be
suppressed by maintain high temperature and choosing proper amount of
steam.
steam -->
Total combustible gas components like CO, H2 and CH4 increased in product gas.
➢ Inert gas content such as N2 and CO2 decreased.
➢ Calorific value of product gas improves.
➢ A part of sensible heat liberated by combustion of carbon is used for conversion of H2
producing reaction.
➢ In case of only air, bed temperature is extremely high, ash melting/fusion probability
is reduced if H2O is used.
water gas shift reaction
CO + H2O(g) → CO2 + H2 ΔH~ -9840 kcal (vi)
➢ In addition to above reaction methane formation reaction (vii) or methanation reaction
between C and H2 also takes place. C + 2H2 CH4 ΔH~ -20840 kcal (vii)
CO + 3 H2 → CH4 + H2O (viii)
➢ Reaction (viii) is made to take place when the aim to maximize the concentration of
methane by maintains the ratio of CO to H2 as 3:1.

other gaseous products

In the low-oxygen, reducing environment of the gasifier, most of the feedstock’s sulfur
coverts to hydrogen sulfide (H2S), with a small amount forming carbonyl sulfide (COS).
➢ Nitrogen chemically bound in the feed generally converts to gaseous nitrogen (N2),
with some ammonia (NH3), and a small amount forming hydrogen cyanide (HCN).
➢ Chlorine is primary converted to hydrogen chloride (HCl).
➢ In general, the quantities of sulfur, nitrogen, and chloride in the fuel are sufficiently
small that they have a negligible effect on the main syngas components of H2 and CO.
➢ Trace elements associated with both organic and inorganic components in the feed,
such as mercury, arsenic and other heavy metals, appear in the various ash and slag
fractions, as well as in gaseous emissions, and need to be removed from the
syngas prior to further use.

role coal properties
Coal reactivity is the main parameters to decide the gasification kinetics.
➢ Mineral matter, VM, FC etc. all plays important role during gasification
➢ As it is chemical reactions among hydrocarbons present in coal and reactant gases (O2,
CO, H2, H2O etc.), reactions at individual components occurs.
➢ Mineral Matter composition also have negative/positive role during such chemical
reaction.
➢ All the reaction are like coal combustion reaction: Simply reactions between
hydrocarbons and reactant gases in presence of impurities (MM).
➢ Hence reaction kinetics and product gas composition will vary depending on coal
composition, reaction conditions etc.

role of moisture
Fuel Used: Coal, lignite, coke, biomass, municipal waste etc.
➢ Fixed-bed gasifiers can accommodate moisture contents of up to 35 percent, provided
the ash content is not in excess of about 10 percent.
➢ Pre-drying may be performed if the moisture and ash contents are above these amounts.
➢ Entrained-flow or fluidized-bed gasifiers require the moisture content to be reduced to
less than about 5 percent by drying to improve coal handleability.
➢ In the entrained-flow system, the residual moisture contributes to the gasification steam
but requires heat to evaporate it.


role of ash
 Chemical composition may affect reaction kinetics, Ash Fusion, Heat transfer,
temperature control inside reactor.
➢ Ash should be kept at a minimum, since provisions must be made for introducing it
to, and withdrawing it from the system, provisions that add to the complexity and
cost of the overall system.
➢ Ash can be used as a heat transfer medium, either by its flow countercurrent to the
products of gasification and gasifying agents in fixed-bed systems or by provisions in
entrained-flow systems.
➢ In fixed-bed systems, ash accumulates at the base of the fuel bed and is withdrawn
by a mechanical grate if un-fused or through a tap hole if it is a liquid slag.
➢ In the entrained-flow system, it is removed as a liquid slag.
The ash fusion temperature is a measure of when the ash will melt and transform
from a solid to liquid state.
➢ This temperature is an important parameter for the design and operation of
gasification systems, for those that operate below the ash fusion temperature so as
not to incur fusion, sintering, or clinkering of the ash, as well as those gasification
systems that operate above the ash fusion temperature to promote slag production.
➢ Another important ash characteristic is the relationship between temperature and
ash viscosity, since it is the flow characteristics of the slag that are critical.
n fluidized-bed systems, the ash is mixed with the char, and the ash is separated
either by sintering and agglomeration of the ash or circulation from the bed through
a fully entrained combustor to melt and separate the ash as a liquid slag.
➢ Fluidized-bed and entrained flow gasifiers tend to have higher losses of carbon in
the ash than the fixed-bed systems.
➢ Ash constituents are important in the selection of materials of construction,
particularly in slagging combustors.
➢ In addition, proper ash composition, or its chemical manipulation through the
addition of fluxing agents, is necessary for desirable slagging operations.

role vm
The volatile matter from the coal can add to the products of gasification without
incurring steam decomposition or oxygen consumption.
➢ The volatile matter, which can vary from less than 5 percent (on a moist, ash-free
basis) for anthracite to over 50 percent for subbituminous coal or lignites, can
consist of carbon oxides, hydrogen, and traces of nitrogen compounds.
➢ The volatile matter composition, the type of coal, and the conditions under which
the volatile matter is driven off all affect the nature of the residual fixed carbon or
char that remains.
➢ Composition of VM may add impurity (gases) in the product gas if not gasified
properly.

role fc
 The nature of the fixed carbon, which is the major component of the char after
the moisture and volatile matter is driven off, is important to the performance of
the gasifier and can vary physically and chemically.
➢ Properties such as density, structure, friability/strength, and reactivity depend
primarily on the original coal, but they are influenced by the pressure, the rate at
which the coal is heated, and its final temperature.
➢ Caking Tendencies The coal’s caking tendencies—strongly caking and swelling,
weakly caking, and noncaking—must be considered during the design of the
gasifier process.
➢ Some gasifiers can be designed to handle caking and swelling coals, but others
will require the coal to be pretreated.
