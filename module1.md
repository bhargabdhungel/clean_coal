## Coal Quality Parameters

Coal is a:

- Naturally occurring, combustible, black or brown, sedimentary rock

### Origin and Formation

- Plant material (branches, roots) mixed with clay soil and rock buried below the earth's surface
- Coalification occurs in the presence of heat, pressure, humidity, and microbial action

### Classification

- Based on extent of natural degradation:
  - Peat (least mature)
  - Lignite
  - Bituminous
  - Anthracite (most mature)

## Coal Composition

### Organic Components

- **Combustibles**: The combustible part of coal includes:

  - **Fixed Carbon (FC)**:
    - Carbon-rich residual matter left after heating
    - Major contributor to Gross Calorific Value (GCV)
  - **Volatile Matter (VM)**:
    - Highly volatile hydrocarbons released when coal is heated to 925°C for 7 minutes in absence of air
    - Excludes moisture loss
    - Some volatile matter may originate from mineral matter decomposition
    - Contains H, N, O-rich hydrocarbons with low molecular weight and low boiling points
    - Contributes to GCV and helps in coal ignition, provides activation for hydrocarbon oxidation

- **Hydrocarbons**: Presence depends upon:
  - Original plant characteristics
  - Extent of coalification over millions of years
  - Structure of coal decides the reaction kinetics and caking properties

### Inorganic Components

- **Mineral Matter**: Inorganic salts (Al, Si, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, etc.)

  - Converted to individual oxides during combustion
  - These oxides are known as ash
  - MM = 1.1 × A (where A is ash content)
  - High silica content increases Abrasion Index (AI)

- **Moisture**: Present in coal (inherent or external)
  - Lower moisture content is preferred
  - When moisture evaporates, it leaves coal with pores, increasing surface area and improving combustion
  - Moisture content analysis helps determine the maturity level of coal

## Coal Analysis Methods

### Proximate Analysis

- Measures moisture, volatile matter (VM), fixed carbon (FC), and mineral matter (MM)
- Uses 72 mesh (212 micron) coal sample size
- **Moisture Determination**:
  - 1g sample kept in hot air oven for one hour at 100°C
  - Mass loss is measured as moisture content
  - Reporting bases: as received, air dry, or equilibrated (40°C, 16% relative humidity)
- **Volatile Matter (VM)**:
  - Coal heated to 925°C in absence of air for 7 minutes
  - Mass loss represents volatile matter content
- **Ash Content**:
  - Coal heated in presence of oxygen at 800°C
  - Residue mass represents ash content
- **Fixed Carbon (FC)**:
  - Calculated as: 100% - moisture% - VM% - ash%

### Ultimate Analysis

- Analyzes elemental composition using 4-15 mg sample
- **Carbon (C)**: Present in both VM and FC
- **Hydrogen (H)**: Typically 4-5%
- **Nitrogen (N)**: Typically 2-3%
- **Sulfur (S)**: Found in hydrocarbons and mineral matter
- **Oxygen (O)**: Typically 5-8%, calculated by difference

### Advanced Analysis Techniques

- **Spectroscopic Analysis**:
  - FTIR and NMR analysis for hydrocarbon bond types
- **Petrographic Analysis**:
  - Microscopic examination of coal structure
  - Gray coloration indicates carbon-rich regions

## Coal Quality Parameters

### Performance Parameters

- **Gross Calorific Value (GCV)**:

  - Represents the amount of energy released when coal is burned
  - Measured in kcal/kg or kJ/kg using bomb calorimeter
  - Premium coal (Grade 1): 7000 kcal/kg
  - Good quality: 6000 kcal/kg
  - Common quality: 3000 kcal/kg
  - Low ash coal has higher GCV

- **Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI)**:

  - Uses 50g sample ground to 72 micron size
  - 40-60 is considered good
  - Values above 60 indicate soft coal

- **Abrasion Index**:
  - Measures abrasive nature of coal
  - Quartz, alumina, and silica are responsible for abrasiveness
  - Measured in mg/kg (wear caused by using 1 kg of coal)
  - Damages conveyor belts, crushers, mills, screens, bunkers, etc.

### Coking Properties

- **Caking and Swelling Characteristics**:

  - Caking index
  - Free swelling index
  - Plasticity/fluidity index
  - LTGK (Low Temperature Gray-King) analysis

- **Coking Process**:

  - During heating (absence of air), coal undergoes thermal cracking reactions
  - Transitions through intermediate plastic/fluid phase
  - Eventually resolidifies as hard solid (coke)
  - Volatile matter is released during this process

- **Quality Requirements**:
  - Low ash content (<18%)
  - High plasticity required for coke making
  - Good swelling properties essential for quality coking coal

### Impurities and Their Effects

- **High Ash Content Effects**:

  - Performance Impact:
    - Lower GCV values
    - Higher hardness, making coal difficult to grind
    - Increased abrasion on equipment
    - Ash fusion temperature determined by composition
    - Liquid ash can damage furnaces and boilers
  - Environmental and Health Concerns:
    - May contain toxic compounds (lead, mercury)
    - Coal ash reflects composition of nearby clay compounds
    - Creates unnecessary transport burden
  - Remediation:
    - Coal cleaning or washing required to reduce ash content

- **Other Impurities**:
  - **Chlorine and Phosphorus**:
    - Measured on case-by-case basis
    - Presence in coal affects steel quality
  - **Sulfur**:
    - Releases SO₂ and SO₃ into atmosphere when burned
    - During coke making, forms H₂S and other sulfur-rich hydrocarbons
    - Typically limited to 1% in coal specifications
    - Environmental and health hazard

### Sulfur

- **Forms of Sulfur in Coal**:

  - **Pyritic Sulfur**: Present in mineral matter as iron pyrites (FeS₂) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂)
  - **Sulfate Sulfur**: Present in mineral matter as FeSO₄, CaSO₄, MgSO₄
  - **Organic Sulfur**: Present in hydrocarbon part as mercaptan, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, thiophenes, etc.

- **Characteristics of High-Sulfur Pyritic Coal**:

  - Tiny veins or seams of pyrite up to 100mm length and 150mm thickness
  - Nodules composed of framboids (10-20 microns) made of octahedral crystals
  - Individual crystals ranging from 1-40 microns in size
  - Removal of pyritic or sulfate sulfur through physical coal cleaning is not possible

- **Characteristics of High-Sulfur Organic Coal**:

  - Contains aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic compounds
  - Sulfur compounds include thiols, sulfides, and disulfides
  - Examples are thiophenols, thioethers, and bithioethers

- **Acid Mine Drainage**:
  - Sulfur combined with water and microbial activity can generate H₂SO₄
  - Creates low pH and highly corrosive environment
  - Chemical Process:
    - Weathering of sulfur: FeS₂ + O₂ + H₂O → Fe²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ + H⁺
    - Oxidation: Fe²⁺ + O₂ + H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + H₂O
    - Hydrolysis: Fe³⁺ + H₂O → Fe(OH)₃ + H⁺
    - Pyrite oxidation: FeS₂ + Fe³⁺ + H₂O → Fe²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ + H⁺
    - Global reaction: 4FeS₂ + 15O₂ + 2H₂O → 4Fe²⁺ + 8SO₄²⁻ + 4H⁺
