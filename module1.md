# Coal: Composition, Properties and Classification

## Coal Origin and Basic Characteristics

- **Definition and Formation**:
  - Naturally occurring, combustible, black or brown sedimentary rock
  - Formed from plant material (branches, roots) mixed with clay soil and rock
  - Coalification occurs through heat, pressure, humidity, and microbial action
  - Classification based on maturity:
    - Peat (least mature)
    - Lignite
    - Bituminous
    - Anthracite (most mature)

## Coal Composition and Structure

### Organic Components

- **Fixed Carbon (FC)**:
  - Carbon-rich residual matter remaining after heating
  - Major contributor to energy content (GCV)
  - Calculated as: 100% - moisture% - VM% - ash%

- **Volatile Matter (VM)**:
  - Released when coal is heated to 925°C for 7 minutes without air
  - Contains H, N, O-rich hydrocarbons with low molecular weight
  - Contributes to calorific value
  - Aids coal ignition and provides activation energy for combustion
  - Some volatile matter may come from mineral matter decomposition

- **Hydrocarbon Structure**:
  - Varies based on original plant characteristics
  - Affected by extent of coalification over time
  - Determines reaction kinetics and caking properties
  - Can be analyzed through FTIR and NMR spectroscopy

### Inorganic Components

- **Mineral Matter**:
  - Inorganic salts containing Al, Si, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, etc.
  - Converts to individual oxides during combustion (ash)
  - Quantified as: MM = 1.1 × Ash content
  - High silica content increases abrasiveness

- **Moisture**:
  - Present in inherent or external forms
  - Lower moisture content is generally preferred
  - Creates pores when evaporated, increasing surface area
  - Helps determine coal maturity level

## Coal Analysis Methods

### Proximate Analysis

- Uses 72 mesh (212 micron) coal sample
- **Moisture Determination**:
  - 1g sample in hot air oven (100°C, 1 hour)
  - Mass loss measured as moisture content
  - Reporting bases: as received, air dry, or equilibrated

- **Volatile Matter (VM)**:
  - Coal heated to 925°C without air for 7 minutes
  - Mass loss represents volatile matter content

- **Ash Content**:
  - Coal heated with oxygen at 800°C
  - Residue mass represents ash content

### Ultimate Analysis

- Elemental composition using 4-15 mg sample
- Measures:
  - **Carbon (C)**: Present in both VM and FC
  - **Hydrogen (H)**: Typically 4-5%
  - **Nitrogen (N)**: Typically 2-3%
  - **Sulfur (S)**: In hydrocarbons and mineral matter
  - **Oxygen (O)**: Typically 5-8%, calculated by difference

### Advanced Analysis Techniques

- **Petrographic Analysis**:
  - Microscopic examination of coal structure
  - Gray coloration indicates carbon-rich regions

## Coal Quality Parameters

### Energy Content

- **Gross Calorific Value (GCV)**:
  - Energy released during complete combustion
  - Measured in kcal/kg or kJ/kg using bomb calorimeter
  - Quality classification:
    - Premium coal (Grade 1): 7000 kcal/kg
    - Good quality: 6000 kcal/kg
    - Common quality: 3000 kcal/kg
  - Low ash coal typically has higher GCV

### Physical Properties

- **Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI)**:
  - Measures coal's grinding difficulty
  - Uses 50g sample ground to 72 micron
  - Scale interpretation:
    - 40-60: Good grindability
    - >60: Soft coal, easier to grind

- **Abrasion Index**:
  - Measures coal's abrasive nature
  - Caused primarily by quartz, alumina, and silica content
  - Units: mg/kg (wear caused by using 1 kg coal)
  - Affects equipment: conveyor belts, crushers, mills, screens, bunkers

### Coking Properties

- **Caking and Swelling Characteristics**:
  - Measured through:
    - Caking index
    - Free swelling index (FSI)
    - Plasticity/fluidity index
    - LTGK (Low Temperature Gray-King) analysis

- **Coking Process**:
  - During heating without air, coal undergoes thermal cracking
  - Transitions through plastic/fluid phase
  - Resolidifies as hard solid (coke)
  - Volatile matter released during process

- **Quality Requirements**:
  - Low ash content (<18%)
  - High plasticity for proper coke making
  - Good swelling properties
  - Used primarily in steel industry

## Impurities in Coal

### Ash Content

- **Performance Impacts**:
  - Reduces calorific value (GCV)
  - Increases hardness and grinding difficulty
  - Causes equipment abrasion
  - Ash fusion temperature depends on composition
  - Liquid ash damages furnaces and boilers

- **Environmental Concerns**:
  - May contain toxic elements (lead, mercury)
  - Reflects composition of nearby clay compounds
  - Creates unnecessary transport burden

- **Remediation**:
  - Coal cleaning/washing reduces ash content

### Sulfur Content

- **Forms of Sulfur**:
  - **Pyritic Sulfur**: As iron pyrites (FeS₂) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂)
    - Appears as veins up to 100mm length, 150mm thickness
    - Forms nodules of framboids (10-20 microns)
    - Individual crystals: 1-40 microns

  - **Sulfate Sulfur**: As FeSO₄, CaSO₄, MgSO₄

  - **Organic Sulfur**: In hydrocarbons as mercaptan, thiols, sulfides
    - Includes thiophenols, thioethers, bithioethers
    - Contains aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic compounds

- **Environmental Impact**:
  - Releases SO₂ and SO₃ when burned
  - Forms H₂S during coke making
  - Generally limited to 1% in specifications
  - Creates acid mine drainage:
    - Generates H₂SO₄ through weathering and microbial activity
    - Chemical process: FeS₂ + O₂ + H₂O → Fe²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ + H⁺
    - Full reaction: 4FeS₂ + 15O₂ + 2H₂O → 4Fe²⁺ + 8SO₄²⁻ + 4H⁺
