downdraft gasifier
he downdraft gasifier is a co-current reactor.
➢ The gasification agent enters the gasifier at a certain height below the top, and it mixes with the
pyrolysis gas products while flow downward in parallel with the solids (char and ash) through the
oxidation and gasification zones.
➢ The drying and pyrolysis zones lie above the oxidation zone and they are maintained at the required
temperature by conduction of the heat generated from the combustion of pyrolysis vapors (including
tar precursors).

 The gases leaving the oxidation zone, mainly CO2 and H2O, are reduced into CO and H2 on the
glowing char in the gasification area.
➢ The gas temperature decreases due to the occurrence of the endothermic gasification up to a
level at which no further reaction takes place.
➢ The unreacted char and the ash are discharged from the bottom. The synthesis gas is removed
from the reactor close to the ash grate.


updraft gasifier

- An updraft gasifier is one of the oldest and simplest of all designs.
➢ Updraft gasifier can be classified as updraft fixed-bed gasifiers, fluidized-bed gasifiers, and circulating
fluidized-bed gasifiers.
➢ Here, the gasification medium (air, oxygen, or steam) travels upward while the bed of fuel moves
downward, and thus the gas and solids are in countercurrent mode.
➢ The product gas leaves from near the top of the gasifier.
➢ Gasifying medium enters the bed through a grate or a distributor, where it meets with the hot
bed of ash.
➢ The ash drops through the grate, which is often made moving (rotating or reciprocating),
especially in large units to facilitate ash discharge.
➢ Feedstock material is first introduced into the drying zone at the top, followed by the pyrolysis
and reduction zone, and finally the unconverted solid passes through the combustion zone.
➢ In the combustion zone, solid charcoal is combusted producing heat, which effectively transfers to
the solid particles during counter-current flow of the rising gas and descending solids.
➢ In this gasification system, the contamination of substantial amount of tars is the major problem
of updraft gasifiers.


crossdraft gasifier
 Cross-draught gasifiers are mostly used for high carbon containing feedstock;
charcoal.
➢ Charcoal gasification results in very high temperatures (1500°C and higher) in
the oxidation zone, which can lead to material problems.
➢ In cross-draught gasifiers, thermal insulation against these high temperatures is
provided by the fuel (charcoal) itself.
➢ Advantages of the system lie in the very small scale at which it can be operated.
➢ A disadvantage of cross-draught gasifiers is their minimal tar-converting
capabilities and the consequent need for high-quality (low-volatile content)
charcoal.

➢ Overall Gasification can be done through Downdraft , updraft or cross draft gasifier.
➢ Sequence of reaction are different in different design and hence design may be modified
as per requirement.
➢ Chemical composition and yield of any gas can be different based on design of reactor.
➢ Product gas may contain some impurities or undesirable gas in different design
➢ Temperature profile of reactor will be different; based on the reactor design,
➢ Exit gas temperature, exit ash temperature will depends on the design.


Lurgi gasifier

 Lurgi gasification process is one of the several processes for which
commercial technology has been fully developed.
➢ Developed in Germany before World War II, this process has been
used in a large number of commercial plants throughout the world.
➢ This process produces low- to medium-calorific value gas as product
gas.
➢ The older version of Lurgi process is dry ash gasification process that
differs significantly from the more recently developed slagging
gasification process.
➢ The Lurgi gasifier is a pressurized, dry-ash, moving bed gasifier that
produces syngas from lump coal, steam, and oxygen as an oxidant.
➢ The dry ash Lurgi gasifier accepts crushed noncaking coals only.
 In this gasifier, coal sized between 1.5 to 4
mesh reacts with steam and oxygen in a
slowly moving bed.
➢ The process is operated semi-continuously.
➢ The gasifier is equipped with the hardware
parts, viz., coal lock hopper, coal
distributor , revolving grate, ash lock
chamber, gas scrubber.
➢ An automated coal lock chamber for
feeding coal from a coal bin to the
pressurized reactor. This device is often
called a coal lock hopper.
 A coal distributor through which coal is uniformly distributed into the moving bed.
➢ A revolving grate through which the steam and oxygen are introduced into the
reacting zone (coal bed) and the ash is removed.
➢ An ash lock chamber for discharging the ash from the pressurized reactor into an
ash bin, where the ash is cooled by water quenching.
➢ A gas scrubber in which the hot gas is quenched and washed before it passes
through a waste heat boiler.
➢ Coal enters the top of the gasifier through a lock hopper and is handled by a rotary
distributor as it begins its descent through the gasifier.
➢ The coal feed is supported at the base of the reactor by a revolving grate through
which the steam and oxygen mixture is introduced and the ash removed.
 Steam and oxygen enter from the bottom, while ash is removed at the bottom by a rotating
grate and lock hopper. This process takes place at around 24 to 31 atm and in the
temperature range of 620 to 760°C.
➢ The residence time in the reactor is about 1 h.
➢ Steam introduced from the bottom of the reactor provides the necessary hydrogen species,
and the heat is supplied by the combustion of a portion of the char.
The product gas from a high-pressure reactor has a relatively high methane content compared
to a non-pressurized gasifier.
➢ The high methane content of the product gas is a result of the relatively low gasification
temperature.
➢ If oxygen is used as an injecting (and gasifying) medium, the exiting gas has a heating value of
approximately 450 Btu/scf.
➢ A high ratio of steam to oxygen helps moderate the temperature such that the ash does not
melt, but rather is removed as dry ash.
The crude gas leaving the gasifier contains a substantial amount of condensable
products including tar, oil, phenol, etc., which are separated in a devolatilizer, where
gas is cleaned to remove unsaturated hydrocarbons and naphtha.
➢ Exiting raw syngas at up to 550 OC is cooled and quenched using recycle water to
condense tars and oils.
➢ A water jacket cools the gasifier vessel and generates part of the steam needed by the
gasifier.
➢ The gas is then subjected to methanation (CO + 3H2 = CH4 + H2O) to produce a high-
Btu gas (pipeline quality).
 High "cold-gas" thermal efficiency, when the heating value of the produced
hydrocarbon liquids is accounted for.
➢ Cold-gas thermal efficiency a measure of how much chemical energy from a solid fuel is
retained in the product gas
➢ Simplicity of gasifier configuration and operation, High equipment efficiency
➢ Relatively low oxidant (oxygen or air) requirement
➢ Less complex feedstock preparation with the use of coarse coal particles
➢ Product gas at relatively low temperatures, thus no need for expensive high-
temperature heat recovery equipment
➢ Feedstock flexibility: suitable to handle coals with high reactivity and moisture
➢ More reactive feedstocks are preferred due to the relatively low-temperature operation.
High methane content in product gas
➢ Limited ability to handle coal fines
➢ Caking coals require design modifications to the gasifier
➢ Long feedstock residence time in gasifier and slag flow characteristics require
carefully controlled feed size distribution for proper operation
➢ Hydrocarbon liquids such as tars and oils are produced; increased effort to clean
produced gas if it is used for applications other than direct heating
➢ Explosion hazard without careful process monitoring

fluidized bed gasifier

- Fluidized Bed Gasifier works on the similar way the Fluidized Bed Combustion units operates.
➢ Air/steam is used to fluidized the solid fuel such as coal, biomass, coke and other feed stock.
➢ Bed material, limestone etc. are also added in the gasifier.
➢ High ash coal can be gasified.
➢ Gasification happens in a bed of inert materials that is hot (usually sand or alumina) and is
suspended through an upward motion of the gasifying medium.
➢ As the flow rate of the gas increases, the bed materials start rising and become “fluidized.”
This fluidization process increases the reactivity between the bed
material (inert material) and biomass.
➢ The rate of reaction is higher in the fluidized bed gasification process in
comparison to the fixed bed gasification process.
➢ Due to the enhanced performance over fixed-bed fluidized bed
systems, they can be operated with a higher range of biomass
feedstock materials, and also at larger scales, and potentially yield a
production gas with calorific value.
➢ However, fluidized bed systems are quite costly and are more complex
in operation.

winkler gasifier
This is the oldest fluidized bed gasifier, and has been in commercial use for many
years. Depending upon its operating conditions, we can group Winkle gasifiers
under low temperature and high-temperature types.
➢ Winkler gasifier, which operates at atmospheric pressure, is a refractory-lined
shaft reactors, which can process coal of about -10.0 mm size.
➢ Coal is continuously fed by a screw from a pressurized hopper and fluidized by a
primary blast immediately above the bottom grate; and a secondary blast just
above the fluidized bed serves to gasify any unreacted char in the product gas
stream.
➢ Ash not leaving with this stream (and removed in an external cyclone) is
withdrawn through the base of the reactor by means of a rotating scraper
Depending on whether a producer gas or syngas is to be made, either an air-
steam or an oxygen-steam blast is used, and outputs can be varied over a
relatively wide range without appreciable loss of efficiency.
➢ A typical syngas will contain 36-37% hydrogen, 45% carbon monoxide, and 16%
carbon dioxide.
➢ However, owing to the construction of the reactor, maximum temperatures
must not exceed ~980°C, and this restricts fuels for Winkler gasification to
lignites and sub-bituminous coals.
➢ Higher rank coals are, as a rule, insufficiently reactive at such comparatively low
temperatures at atmospheric pressure, but now with the use of pressurize
system all coal can be used .

krw gasifier
The KRW gasifier, is a pressurized, dry-feed, fluidized-bed slagging
gasifier developed by M.W. Kellogg Company.
➢ The KRW gasifier can gasify all types of coals, including high-sulfur,
high-ash, low-rank, and high-swelling coals.
➢ Crushed Coal and limestone to less than 1/4 inch are fed into the
bottom of the gasifier, with the air or oxygen entering through
concentric high velocity jets.
➢ This ensures thorough mixing of the fuel and air/oxygen.
➢ The coal immediately releases its volatile matter upon entering the
gasifier, which oxidizes rapidly, producing the heat for the
gasification reactions.

kopper totzek gasifier
The Koppers–Totzek process, which has been commercially used
since 1938, is an entrained-solids process which operates at
atmospheric pressure.
➢ The reactor is a relatively small, cylindrical, refractory-lined coal
“burner” into which coal, oxygen, and steam are injected through
two or four tangentially disposed "burner heads".
➢ Steam is introduced around these heads to cover the reaction
zone and protect the vessel walls from excessive heat; product
gas is taken off through a collector pipe at the top; and ash leaves
as a molten slag through the bottom.
The feed coal for the process is crushed (70% passing 75 m), mixed with O2 and
low-pressure steam, and injected into the gasifier through a burner head.
➢ The heads are spaced 180° or 90° apart (representing two-headed or four-
headed opposed burner arrangements) and are designed such that steam
envelopes the flame and protects the reactor walls from excessive heat.
➢ The reactor typically operates at an exit temperature of about 1480°C and the
pressure is maintained just slightly above atmospheric.
➢ Only about 85%–90% of the total carbon may be gasified in a single pass through
the gasifier because carbon conversion is a function of the reactivity of the coal
and approaches 100% for lignite.
Gasification proceeds rapidly at temperature of 1500 – 19500C in the chamber.
The product gas leaves the gasifier at 1400-15000C and is passed through a
radiation boiler and waste heat boiler for the recovery of sensible heat.
➢ Appreciable amount of coal dust is carried with the gas. This is removed in dust
catchers and the coal is used again. Half of the ash is deposited on gasifier wall as
a fluid slag. It flows down and finally removed from the bottom.
➢ This process generates no tars, and yields a substantially methane free synthesis
gas that typically may contains 30-32% H2, 55% CO and 12% CO2.
➢ The heat in the reactor causes the formation of slag and is removed from the
bottom of the gasifier through a water seal.
 Gases and vaporized hydrocarbons produced by the coal immediately pass
through a zone of very high temperature in which they decompose so rapidly that
coal particles in the plastic stage do not agglomerate, and thus, any type of coal
can be gasified irrespective of caking tendencies, ash content, or ash fusion
temperature.
➢ High operating temperature ensures that the gas product contains no ammonia,
tars, phenols, or condensable hydrocarbons.
➢ The raw gas can be upgraded to synthesis gas by reacting all or part of the carbon
monoxide content with steam to produce additional hydrogen plus carbon
dioxide.
 Major advantages is its ability to accept all types of coal without any prior
treatment other than pulverization and some flexibility in ash removal: Instead
of being tapped off as a slag, ash can also, where so desired, be removed as fly
ash with the raw gas and then separated from it in an external cyclone.
➢ The high operating temperature also allows very fast gasification.
➢ In view of this exceptionally high capacity and the modest cost of the Koppers-
Totzek generator, its relatively low carbon inventory and consequent above-
average oxygen consumption are generally not serious disadvantages.
➢ Disadvantage is the loss of sensible heat when the raw gas, which exits at
1260-1480°C, is cooled to ambient temperatures for cleaning and from the
need to compress the clean gas for downstream chemical syntheses.



syn gas cleaning
During Gasification, syngas is produced. Major useful components are H2 and CO gas.
➢ However, the syn gas produced from reactor may contain other gases, vapors as well as
fine particles also.
➢ Major contaminants present in syngas generally include SPM, condensable hydrocarbons
(i.e. tars), sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, alkali metals and their slats (primarily
potassium and sodium), HCl etc.
➢ Exact gas composition depends on feedstock characteristics and gasification reaction
kinetics.
➢ The level of cleaning that is required may also vary substantially depending on
the end-use technology and/or emission standards.
➢ CO2 is also considered as impurities if not desired by the user industries

spm
 Particle matter released from a gasifier range of about 1 mm -100 mm, and can vary widely
depending on the feedstock and process.
➢ Inorganic compounds and residual solid carbon from the gasification of coal /biomass
constitutes the bulk of the SPM, although bed material or catalysts can also be elutriated.
➢ The inorganic content includes alkali metals (potassium and sodium); alkaline earth metals
(mostly calcium); silica (SiO2); and other metals such as iron and magnesium.
➢ Minor constituents present in trace amounts are primarily derived from solid fossil carbon
feedstocks and include arsenic, selenium, antimony, zinc, and lead.
➢ Many syngas applications require greater than 99% particulate removal.
➢ Fouling, corrosion and erosion, which cause efficiency and safety concerns.

tar
 Tars are composed of condensable organic compounds. They vary from primary
oxygenated products to heavier deoxygenated hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs).
➢ Thermochemical conversion processes create hundreds or even thousands of different
tar species in response to the operating parameters.
➢ The complex chemical nature of tar creates difficulties in collecting, analyzing, and
even defining what constitutes tar.

sulfur
Sulfur contaminants occur mostly as H2S with lesser amounts of carbonyl sulfide (COS).
➢ H2S may range in concentration from 0.1 mL/L to 30 mL/L, depending on the feedstock.
➢ Biomass has significantly less sulfur than coal. Some forms of biomass, including a few
grasses and black liquor (a byproduct of the pulp and paper industry), can still have
sulfur contents exceeding 1 g/kg.
➢ Sulfur compounds corrode metal surfaces. If syngas is burned, sulfur contaminants are
oxidized to sulfur dioxide (SO2).
➢ Even small amounts of sulfur can poison catalysts used to clean or upgrade syngas.
➢ Sulfur removal to ppb levels is often required to avoid their detrimental effects.

syn gas cleaning

 Most nitrogen contaminants in syngas occur as NH3 and HCN.
➢ The pyrolysis stage of gasification and combustion releases nitrogen from protein structures or
heterocyclic aromatic compounds in the feedstock.
➢ The amount of NH3 and HCN released is heavily dependent on intrinsic properties (N content,
functionalities) and physical properties (particle size) as well as process conditions.
➢ NH3 is typically the dominant form of nitrogen contaminants compared to HCN or others.
➢ It can be formed directly from biomass in primary reactions or from HCN in secondary gas
phase reactions.
➢ As the temperature increases, HCN as well as NH3 concentration increases.
➢ Availability of H2 and residence time will convert the HCN to NH3.


 Many gasification feedstocks naturally contain alkali and alkaline earth metals.
➢ Concentrations of alkali in biomass can vary substantially but are typically much greater
than in coal.
➢ Woody biomass tends to contain more alkaline earth metals, while herbaceous biomass
contains higher levels of alkali metals.
➢ The alkali metals are primarily potassium and to a lesser extent sodium, and are more
problematic in syngas applications than alkaline earth metals due to their higher
reactivity.

 Chlorides are the predominant halide in syngas, usually in the form of HCl.
➢ Chlorine in biomass occurs as alkali metal salts, which readily vaporize in the high
temperature environment of combustors, pyrolizers, or gasifiers and react with water
vapor to form HCl.
➢ Raw syngas may contain up to several milliliters of chloride for every liter of syngas.


 There are many variables in gas cleaning, and the precise area of application of a given process is
difficult to define although there are several factors that need to be considered:
(a) the types and concentrations of contaminants in the gas
(b) the degree of contaminant removal desired;
(c) the selectivity of acid gas removal required;
(d) the temperature, pressure, volume, and composition of the gas to be processed;
(f) the desirability of sulfur recovery due to process economics or environmental issues.
(e) the CO2 to hydrogen sulfide ratio in the gas

Based on the impurities present, individual or combined pollutant removal mechanism is
adopted.
➢ For SPM: Cyclone separator, settling tank etc.
➢ For Sulfur, Nitrogen compounds: Chemical based absorption od adsorption or catalytic
reactions.
➢ For Hydrocarbons/Tar: suitable catalytic reaction or absorption or adsorption etc.


Cogeneration or coproduction in the context of gasification refers to the ability for a
gasification plant to vary the downstream processing of the produced syngas depending
on market conditions, to optimize profits as well as sustain in difficult situation.
➢ For example, gasification plant may add additional units/ plants in downstream such as
➢ Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) based power plant
➢ Supplying waste heat to nearby other plants
➢ Supplying steam (generated from heat released during gasification) to other chemical
plants
➢ Installing plants for converting the syngas into chemicals or liquid fuels
➢ Purifying syngas to produce individual CO, H2, CH4 etc gases.
➢ Such approach helps the gasification plants to survive or increase profit.


 Coal gasification can be used as center point for different industries.
➢ Hydrogen and other gas can be produced from coal through gasification route
➢ Gasification open the pathways for coal to chemicals.
➢ Gasification at low temperature results in impurities at syn gas but no slagging of ash
➢ Gasification at high temperature results in better quality syn gas but slagging of ash occurs
➢ Lurgi gasifier as well as fluidized bed gasifier both can be used in gasification depending on
types of feed stock and syn gas quality requirement.
➢ Gasification can be used as additional step for coal utilization in power generation,
particularly for inferior quality coal/ feed stock.
