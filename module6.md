# Coal Combustion Methods

## Overview of Coal Combustion Technologies

- **Classification of Coal Combustion Methods**:

  - Several methods exist for burning coal in domestic and industrial applications
  - Each method has its own merits, demerits, and optimal applications
  - Three primary combustion approaches:
    - Fuel bed combustion: Burns lump coal (larger size) on grates
    - Pulverized coal combustion: Burns finely powdered coal
    - Fluidized bed combustion: Burns crushed coal in a fluidized state

## Fuel Bed Combustion

- **System Configuration**:

  - Coal is burned on a grate system
  - Typically charged from the top of the bed or from bottom in some designs
  - Forms distinct combustion layers during operation
  - Five different layers are observed:
    - Freshly charged coal (known as green coal)
    - Drying zone: Layer where coal loses moisture
    - Distillation zone: Coking layer where coal releases volatile matter
    - Combustion zone: Coke layer where fixed carbon is burned
    - Ash zone: Region where ash is cooling

- **Operating Principles**:

  - Primary air enters and gets heated in the ash layer
  - Air passes through the coke layer (approximately 1200°C), initiating combustion: C + O₂ → CO₂
  - In upper zones, reactions continue: CO₂ + C → 2CO
  - Carbon monoxide mixes with volatile matter and moisture
  - Final gas mixture contains CO₂, CO, H₂O, and N₂
  - Secondary air must be added to ensure complete combustion

- **Underfeed Systems**:

  - Coal is fed from the bottom through mechanical arrangements like screw conveyors
  - Primary air passes through holes to mix with fresh coal
  - Primary air first removes moisture and volatile matter from coal
  - Gas mixture then passes through the coke zone for volatile matter combustion
  - Secondary air is required for complete combustion

- **Performance Characteristics**:

  - Primarily used for lower temperature applications
  - Slower combustion rate with some unburned carbon in ash
  - Simpler operation with less stringent coal preparation requirements
  - Requires longer time for complete combustion
  - Easy to operate, minimal coal crushing required

## Pulverized Coal Combustion

- **System Design**:

  - Used in large installations like thermal power plants and cement kilns
  - Coal is fired in pulverized form with consistency similar to talcum powder
  - Coal is pulverized in ball mills or impact mills
  - Typical fineness is 85% below 200 mesh size (75 μm)
  - Preheated air at approximately 110-300°C passes over coal during grinding
  - Waste heat from flue gas often used to preheat the coal

- **Combustion Process**:

  - Coal is premixed with primary air to transport coal mixture to burners
  - Remaining combustion air (secondary and tertiary) is supplied later
  - Coal particles are heated by flame radiation as they travel through burner
  - Volatile matter is emitted and burned in this process
  - Typical residence time for complete combustion is less than 5 seconds
  - Furnaces classified as horizontal, vertical, or tangential firing based on configuration

- **Advantages**:

  - **Operational Benefits**:
    - Low excess air requirement
    - Reduced fan power consumption
    - Higher boiler efficiency
    - Fast response to load changes
    - High combustion efficiency
    - Reduces time for raising steam temperature
    - Readily adaptable to automatic control systems

  - **Fuel and Performance Flexibility**:
    - Ability to burn wide variety of coals
    - Easy integration with alternate fuels
    - Can work successfully alone or with gas and oil
    - Ability to release large amounts of heat in small combustors
    - Achieves higher steam temperatures
    - Produces fly ash suitable for various applications
    - Can replace liquid and gaseous fuel applications

- **Disadvantages**:

  - **Economic Considerations**:
    - Added cost for coal preparation and grinding
    - Complicated equipment requirements
    - Higher auxiliary power consumption
    - Additional power required for fly ash and flue gas handling
    - Increased costs for pollution control equipment

  - **Environmental and Safety Concerns**:
    - Higher particulate emissions without controls
    - Special efforts required for ash collection
    - Increased explosion risk
    - Storage of powdered coal requires special fire protection

## Fluidized Bed Combustion

- **Fundamental Principles**:

  - Process involves combustion of solid fuels in a fluidized state
  - Fluidization converts granular material from static solid state to dynamic fluid-like state
  - Coal is fluidized using pressurized air through a bed with gaps
  - Fuel particles are suspended in a hot, bubbling fluidity bed
  - Bed typically contains sand, limestone, and recycled ash
  - Jets of air provide oxygen required for combustion
  - Fast mixing of gas and solids promotes rapid heat transfer and chemical reactions

- **System Components**:

  - Coal: Primary fuel that burns in the combustion chamber
  - Limestone: Removes sulfur gases (SOₓ) during combustion
  - Bed material/Sand: Optimizes the fluidization process
  - Ash: Initially absent but later supplied from ash recycling

- **FBC Technology Types**:

  - **Atmospheric Fluidized Bed Combustion (AFBC)**:
    - Coal crushed to 1-10 mm depending on coal rank
    - Fluidizing air velocity ranges from 1.2 to 3.7 m/sec
    - Uses in-bed evaporator tubes for heat extraction
    - Typical bed depth ranges from 0.9 m to 1.5 m

  - **Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion (CFBC)**:
    - Higher intra-furnace gas velocity at 4 to 8 m/s
    - Feed coal particle size approximately 6-12 mm
    - Includes cyclone for recycling material back to boiler
    - Recycling maintains bed height and increases de-nitration

  - **Internal Circulating Systems (ICFBC)**:
    - Cyclone separator placed nearby or inside combustor
    - Provides better temperature control and reduces heat loss
    - Internal circulation improves heat transfer efficiency
    - Increases residence time for more complete combustion

  - **Pressurized Systems (PICFBC)**:
    - ICFBC system mounted in a pressurized vessel
    - Higher pressure improves combustion driving force
    - Increases partial pressure of oxygen
    - Enables reduced reactor size for same thermal output

- **Advantages**:

  - **Performance Efficiency**:
    - High combustion efficiency (over 95%) regardless of ash content
    - Overall thermal efficiency around 84%
    - Smaller boiler size due to high heat transfer rates
    - Less excess air required, resulting in higher CO₂ concentration

  - **Fuel Flexibility**:
    - Operates efficiently with various fuel types
    - Handles low-grade fuels effectively (washery rejects, agro waste)
    - Different fuels can be fed independently or in combination
    - Excellent for burning fines and low-grade coal

  - **Environmental Benefits**:
    - Superior control of SOₓ and NOₓ emissions
    - Easier ash removal with no clinker formation
    - No grinding required for coal (2-10 mm size sufficient)
    - Operating temperature around 900°C reduces NOₓ formation

- **Disadvantages**:

  - Limited to lower temperature and capacity applications
  - Longer time required for complete combustion
  - Higher erosion rate for boiler tubes
  - Lower capacity compared to pulverized coal units
  - Increased polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions due to lower temperatures
